abstract = {Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37\% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n = 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32\% of SOM variance (n = 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage.},

@article{Kaiser2011,
abstract = {Soil microbes in temperate forest ecosystems are able to cycle several hundreds of kilograms of N per hectare per year and are therefore of paramount importance for N retention. Belowground C allocation by trees is an important driver of seasonal microbial dynamics and may thus directly affect N transformation processes over the course of the year. Our study aimed at unraveling plant controls on soil N cycling in a temperate beech forest at a high temporal resolution over a time period of two years, by investigating the effects of tree girdling on microbial N turnover. In both years of the experiment, we discovered (1) a summer N mineralization phase (between July and August) and (2) a winter N immobilization phase (November-February). The summer mineralization phase was characterized by a high N mineralization activity, low microbial N uptake, and a subsequent high N availability in the soil. During the autumn/winter N immobilization phase, gross N mineralization rates were low, and microbial N uptake exceeded microbial N mineralization, which led to high levels of N in the microbial biomass and low N availability in the soil. The observed immobilization phase during the winter may play a crucial role for ecosystem functioning, since it could protect dissolved N that is produced by autumn litter degradation from being lost from the ecosystem during the phase when plants are mostly inactive. The difference between microbial biomass N levels in winter and spring equals 38 kg N/ha and may thus account for almost one-third of the annual plant N demand. Tree girdling strongly affected annual N cycling: the winter N immobilization phase disappeared in girdled plots (microbial N uptake and microbial biomass N were significantly reduced, while the amount of available N in the soil solution was enhanced). This was correlated to a reduced fungal abundance in autumn in girdled plots. By releasing recently fixed photosynthates to the soil, plants may thus actively control the annual microbial N cycle. Tree belowground C allocation increases N accumulation in microorganisms during the winter which may ultimately feed back on plant N availability in the following growing season.},

abstract = {The microbial degradation of lignin has been well studied in white-rot and brown-rot fungi, but is much less well studied in bacteria. Recent published work suggests that a range of soil bacteria, often aromatic-degrading bacteria, are able to break down lignin. The enzymology of bacterial lignin breakdown is currently not well understood, but extracellular peroxidase and laccase enzymes appear to be involved. There are also reports of aromatic-degrading bacteria isolated from termite guts, though there are conflicting reports on the ability of termite gut micro-organisms to break down lignin. If biocatalytic routes for lignin breakdown could be developed, then lignin represents a potentially rich source of renewable aromatic chemicals.},

@book{Sterner2002,
abstract = {All life is chemical. That fact underpins the developing field of ecological stoichiometry, the study of the balance of chemical elements in ecological interactions. This long-awaited book brings this field into its own as a unifying force in ecology and evolution. Synthesizing a wide range of knowledge, Robert Sterner and Jim Elser show how an understanding of the biochemical deployment of elements in organisms from microbes to metazoa provides the key to making sense of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. After summarizing the chemistry of elements and their relative abundance in Earth's environment, the authors proceed along a line of increasing complexity and scale from molecules to cells, individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems. The book examines fundamental chemical constraints on ecological phenomena such as competition, herbivory, symbiosis, energy flow in food webs, and organic matter sequestration. In accessible prose and with clear mathematical models, the authors show how ecological stoichiometry can illuminate diverse fields of study, from metabolism to global change.Set to be a classic in the field, Ecological Stoichiometry is an indispensable resource for researchers, instructors, and students of ecology, evolution, physiology, and biogeochemistry. From the foreword by Peter Vitousek: "[T]his book represents a significant milestone in the history of ecology. . . . Love it or argue with it--and I do both--most ecologists will be influenced by the framework developed in this book. . . . There are points to question here, and many more to test . . . And if we are both lucky and good, this questioning and testing will advance our field beyond the level achieved in this book. I can't wait to get on with it."},

@article{Jeffries1981,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that a lignin-degrading system appears in cultures of the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium in response to nitrogen starvation, apparently as part of secondary metabolism. We examined the influence of limiting carbohydrate, sulfur, or phosphorus and the effect of varying the concentrations of four trace metals, Ca, and Mg. Limitation of carbohydrate or sulfur but not limitation of phosphorus triggered ligninolytic activity. When only carbohydrate was limiting, supplementary carbohydrate caused a transient repression of activity. In carbohydrate-limited cultures, ligninolytic activity appeared when the supplied carbohydrate was depleted, and this activity was associated with a decrease in mycelial dry weight. The amount of lignin degraded depended on the amount of carbohydrate provided, which determined the amount of mycelium produced during primary growth. Carbohydrate-limited cultures synthesized only small amounts of the secondary metabolite veratryl alcohol compared with nitrogen-limited cultures. l-Glutamate sharply repressed ligninolytic activity in carbohydrate-starved cultures, but NH(4) did not. Ligninolytic activity was also triggered in cultures supplied with 37 muM sulfur as the only limiting nutrient. The balance of trace metals, Mg, and Ca was important for lignin degradation.},

In addition to the myco- and photobiont, L. pulmonaria harbors proteins from a highly diverse prokaryotic community, which is dominated by Proteobacteria and including also Archaea. While fungal proteins are most dominant (75.4\% of all assigned spectra), about the same amount of spectra were assigned to prokaryotic proteins (10\%) and to the green algal photobiont (9\%). While the latter proteins were found to be mainly associated with energy and carbohydrate metabolism, a major proportion of fungal and bacterial proteins appeared to be involved in PTMs and protein turnover and other diverse functions.},

abstract = {Lignin, a resistant cell-wall constituent of all vascular plants that consists of ether and carbon-linked methoxyphenols, is still far from being structurally described in detail. The main problem in its structural elucidation is the difficulty of isolating lignin from other wood components without damaging lignin itself. Furthermore, the high number and variegated forms of linkages that occur between the monomeric units and the chemical resistance of certain ether bonds limit the extent to which analytical and degradation procedures can be used to elucidate the lignin structure. Most of our present knowledge about the molecular structure of lignin is based on the analysis of monomers, dimers or, at the most, tetramers of degraded isolated lignins. Mass spectrometry (MS), which offers advantages in terms of speed, specificity, and sensitivity, has revealed to be a very powerful technique in the structural elucidation of lignins, in combination with the great number of chemical and thermal degradation methods available in the study of lignin. Moreover, the recent development of new ionization techniques in MS-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS-has provided new possibilities to also analyze the undegraded lignin macromolecule.},

abstract = {This work is part of a research program with the general objective of evaluating soil sustainability in areas surrounding hydroelectric reservoirs, which have been planted with riparian forest. The specific aims were: (i) to assess if and how the soil organic matter (SOM) chemical composition has changed in such areas, and (ii) to contribute to the knowledge of SOM chemistry in Brazil. To this end, we sampled litter and soil (Anionic Acrustox) in two adjacent areas: one under native vegetation and another forested with riparian species in 1992. The native vegetation was Brazilian savannah orcerrado. In this case, it was a ‘grassy cerrado’, dominated by grasses with few shrubs. Litter was collected and humic substances were extracted from soil by an alkaline solution. Both were characterised by a combination of cross-polarisation-magic angle spinning (CPMAS) solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Eight years after forestation, the addition of the forest litter had changed SOM chemical composition. The C input pattern exerted a key role on the observed alterations. In the grassy cerrado, litter addition is predominantly below-ground and the litter is richer in carbohydrate-derived compounds and poorer in lignin moieties. In the forested area, C input is largely above-ground and grass litter has been partially replaced by a relatively more recalcitrant material. As a result, topsoil under forest was chemically strongly different from that under cerrado. Factor analysis indicated that the largest differences were between topsoil under forest and deepest subsoil under cerrado, where there is influence of remaining cerrado-derived C. Both semi-quantification and factor analysis of pyrolysis data gave further insight on the extent of alterations, but more research on such a quantitative approach should be developed to detail its application in SOM studies.},

Degradation of the occluded light fraction was not fully halted, but was different from that of SOM in the extractable fraction. Recalcitrant compounds had low abundances in the free light and extracted fractions, but were more abundant in the occluded light fraction, where the more accessible compounds were depleted by microbial decomposition. Because of intense decomposition, the extracted fractions did not differentiate between land uses, but differences in the light fractions were significant. The results indicate that the decay of the occluded fraction is different from that of the free light fraction: non-ideal circumstances of decay caused a relative accumulation of potentially recalcitrant compounds. When considering the rapid turnover of all components in the soil extracts, disruption of aggregates will probably cause rapid decay of the occluded fraction. The distribution of pyrolysis products that can be ascribed to charred wood (polyaromatics) indicates that this fraction is readily decayed if not occluded. Selective decomposition in the occluded fraction may cause a shift in delta 13C that should not be misinterpreted.},

abstract = {We present a method for determining the natural abundance radiocarbon (14C) content of soil microbial biomass (SMB) based on existing fumigation–extraction procedures. We applied the technique to soils from the foreland of the \"{O}denwinkelkees glacier in the Austrian Alps, which has a well-characterised chronosequence of soils at different stages of development. Across the chronosequence, SMB contained post-bomb levels of 14C, suggesting it was substantially composed of carbon that had been fixed since the 1960s. Comparison of our results with previous findings from the same site showed that at most stages in the sequence the SMB had a similar 14C content to the bulk soil organic matter (SOM). However, soil respired CO2 was 14C-depleted relative to SMB, indicating that at least a component of the microbial community was mineralising some older carbon. In the most recently exposed soils, SMB was 14C-enriched compared to both soil respiration and SOM, suggesting that a small component of the microbial biomass that utilises older carbon contributes disproportionately more to the CO2 efflux. Although other interpretations are possible, this explanation is consistent with the notion that early on in the succession a large proportion of the microbial biomass is dormant.},

To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. METHODOLOGY: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.},

@article{Gill2006,
abstract = {The interaction between nitrogen cycling and carbon sequestration is critical in predicting the consequences of anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 (hereafter, Ca). The progressive N limitation (PNL) theory predicts that carbon sequestration in plants and soils with rising Ca may be constrained by the availability of nitrogen in many ecosystems. Here we report on the interaction between C and N dynamics during a four-year field experiment in which an intact C3/C4 grassland was exposed to a gradient in Ca from 200 to 560 micromol/mol. There were strong species effects on decomposition dynamics, with C loss positively correlated and N mineralization negatively correlated with Ca for litter of the C3 forb Solanum dimidiatum, whereas decomposition of litter from the C4 grass Bothriochloa ischaemum was unresponsive to Ca. Both soil microbial biomass and soil respiration rates exhibited a nonlinear response to Ca, reaching a maximum at approximately 440 micromol/mol Ca. We found a general movement of N out of soil organic matter and into aboveground plant biomass with increased Ca. Within soils we found evidence of C loss from recalcitrant soil C fractions with narrow C:N ratios to more labile soil fractions with broader C:N ratios, potentially due to decreases in N availability. The observed reallocation of N from soil to plants over the last three years of the experiment supports the PNL theory that reductions in N availability with rising Ca could initially be overcome by a transfer of N from low C:N ratio fractions to those with higher C:N ratios. Although the transfer of N allowed plant production to increase with increasing Ca, there was no net soil C sequestration at elevated Ca, presumably because relatively stable C is being decomposed to meet microbial and plant N requirements. Ultimately, if the C gained by increased plant production is rapidly lost through decomposition, the shift in N from older soil organic matter to rapidly decomposing plant tissue may limit net C sequestration with increased plant production.},

Here, we use data from a beech/oak forest on concentrations and stable isotope ratios of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phosphate buffer-extractable organic carbon, soil organic carbon (SOC), respiration and microbial gross assimilation of N to show that respired soil carbon originated from DOC. However, the respiration was not dependent on the DOC concentration but exceeded the daily DOC pool three to four times, suggesting that DOC was turned over several times per day. A mass flow model helped to calculate that a maximum of 40\% of the daily DOC production was derived from SOC and to demonstrate that degradation of SOC is limiting respiration of DOC. The carbon flow model on SOC, DOC, microbial C mobilization/immobilization and respiration is linked by temperature-dependent microbial and enzyme activity to global warming effects of CO(2) emitted to the atmosphere.},

However, with the recent demonstration that spectral counting is a powerful quantitative proteomic approach, the analysis of multiprotein complexes by mass spectrometry can be reconsidered in certain cases. Using the chromatography-based approach named multidimensional protein identification technology, multiprotein complexes may be analyzed quantitatively using the normalized spectral abundance factor that allows comparison of multiple independent analyses of samples. This study describes an approach to visualize multiprotein complex datasets that provides structure function information that is superior to tabular lists of data.

A series of sedge (Eriophorum vaginatum) macrofossils from an Upper Holocene peat profile has been studied by analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS). The major diagenetic changes of biopolymers included loss of ester-bound ferulic and coumaric acids, an increase of oxidation (particularly due to C$\alpha$ ketones) and shortening of alkyl side-chains, demethylation of methoxy groups of the lignin/polyphenol fraction, loss of pentosan polysaccharides and modification of cellulose (relative increase in the pyrolytic yield of anhydroglucose). The yield of oxidized methoxy-moieties (particularly of C$\alpha$ ketones) and shortening of alkyl side-chains of methoxyphenols were suggested as the best indicators of oxidative degradation. Statistically significant differences in chemical composition between samples from individual depth increments occur, in part in agreement with a sequence of wet and dry phases determined by paleobotanical analysis. The paleoenvironmental significance of the chemical record of degradation and relationship of paleohydrology reconstructed by the present technique and by means of botanical analysis is discussed. The former was proposed to respond primarily to the frequency of seasonal droughts.},

We hypothesised that bacteria targeting recalcitrant carbon compounds require relatively high levels of N availability to support the construction costs of requisite extracellular and transport enzymes. Indeed, we found that taxa that used more recalcitrant (i.e. larger and cyclic) carbon compounds were more prevalent in ocean waters with higher nitrate concentrations. Compared to recalcitrant carbon users, labile carbon users targeted more organic N compounds, were found in relatively nitrate-poor waters, and were more common in higher latitude soils, which is consistent with the paradigm that N-limitation is stronger at higher latitudes. Altogether, evolutionary trade-offs may limit recalcitrant carbon users to habitats with higher N availability.},

abstract = {Soil macrofauna play an essential role in the initial comminution and degradation of organic matter entering the soil environment and yet the chemical effects of digestion on leaf litter are poorly understood at the molecular level. This study was undertaken to assess the selective chemical transformations that saprophagous soil invertebrates mediate in consumed leaf litter. A number of pill millipedes (Glomeris marginata) were fed oak leaves (Quercus robur) after which the biomolecular compositions (lipids and macromolecular components) of the leaves and millipede faeces were compared using a series of wet chemical techniques and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). It was found that the concentrations of short chain (\&lt; C-20) n-alkanoic acids, sterols and triaclglycerols reduced dramatically in the millipede faeces relative to the leaf litter. Hydrolysable carbohydrates and proteins both decreased in concentration in the faeces, whereas similar yields of phenolic components were observed for the cupric oxidation products of lignin, although the oxygenated functionalities were affected by passage through the millipede gut, yielding a more highly condensed state for lignin. This shows that the chemical composition of fresh organic matter entering the soil is directly controlled by invertebrates feeding upon the leaf litter and as such that they are key contributors to the early stages of diagenesis in terrestrial soils.

abstract = {Forages and by-products, such as stovers and hulls, are important ruminant feedstuffs. Considerable effort is expended on composition determination, including research to better understand the relationship between composition and utilization by ruminants. Most of the procedures used are empirical in nature and make such determinations difficult at best. For example, the primary procedures used to determine a forage's potential feeding value are based on fiber determinations using extractive procedures. While it is possible to chemically analyze feedstuffs in a non-empirical fashion, the analyses required are so time consuming and extensive as to be generally impractical. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS), on the other hand, is simple to carry out and generates no waste, while being capable of simultaneously providing information on the composition of many or all of the feedstuff constituents. Research has demonstrated that PY-GC/MS can provide detailed information on constituents such as lignin, tannins, carbohydrates, etc. The information provided has been shown to be useful in determining the basis for wet chemical procedures (i.e. what exactly does a procedure determine), in differentiating subtle differences in composition between varieties of the same plant species, and in comparing the overall composition of one material to another. Finally, PY-GC/MS can be a tremendous tool for the determination of forage and by-product composition which has until now been largely ignored by animal nutritionists and forage researchers.

abstract = {Litter decomposition is controlled by three main factors: climate, litter quality and the nature and abundance of the decomposing organisms. Climate is the dominant factor in areas subjected to unfavourable weather conditions, whereas litter quality largely prevails as the regulator under favourable conditions. Litter quality remains important until the late decomposition stages through its effects on humus formation. Interest in the role of litter decomposition in the global carbon cycle has increased recently since (1) increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will probably affect the chemical quality of litter (especially nitrogen content), and (2) global warming may enhance decomposition rates.},

An enhanced HPSEC-UVA system employing a modified commercially available DOC detector provides a better understanding of the qualitative and quantitative natural organic matter (NOM) properties in water samples by detecting aromatic and nonaromatic fractions of NOM as a function of molecular weight (MW). The most critical merit of this system is that the DOC detector is readily available and widely used. With only a few modifications, a commercially available TOC analyzer served as a DOC detector, integrated with the HPSEC to measure DOC along with UVA, and provided a specific UVA (SUVA) chromatograph that is useful information for drinking water plant design and operation. Without preconcentration, samples can be analyzed with a small amount of sample, with a DOC detection limit as low as 0.1 mg/L (as DOC).},

@article{Heim2007,
abstract = {Summary When modelling the carbon dynamics of temperate soils, soil organic carbon (SOC) is often represented by three kinetic pools, i.e. fast, slow and passive/inert. Lignin is often considered to be relatively resistant to decomposition, thus possibly contributing to the passive SOC pool. One way to assess SOC turnover under natural conditions is to follow the fate of 13C-labelled biomass in soils. We used compound-specific isotope analysis to analyse CuO oxidation products of lignin from grassland topsoils and from an arable topsoil that had received a natural (by C3-C4 vegetation change) or an artificial (by fumigation with labelled CO2) isotopic label for 9-23 years. Results indicate faster apparent turnover for lignin (5-26 years in grassland, 9-38 years in arable soil) compared with bulk SOC (20-26 years in grassland, 51 years in arable soil). Although these calculated lignin turnover times cannot be extrapolated to the whole soil profiles, this paper provides isotopic evidence that lignin in soils is not preferentially preserved, which is a consistent result from both ways of isotopic labelling. It also demonstrates, however, that a considerable proportion of lignin in temperate soils can be stabilized for at least a few decades.},

Employing the expectation maximization algorithm, the analysis learns to distinguish correct from incorrect database search results, computing probabilities that peptide assignments to spectra are correct based upon database search scores and the number of tryptic termini of peptides. Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.},

Standard proteins yield the same peptide maps when extracted from Coomassie- and silver-stained gels, as judged by electrospray and MALDI mass spectrometry. The low nanogram range can be reached by the protocols described here, and the method is robust. A silver-stained one-dimensional gel of a fraction from yeast proteins was analyzed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In the sequencing, more than 1000 amino acids were covered, resulting in no evidence of chemical modifications due to the silver staining procedure. Silver staining allows a substantial shortening of sample preparation time and may, therefore, be preferable over Coomassie staining. This work removes a major obstacle to the low-level sequence analysis of proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels.},

This review describes the composition of lignocellulosic materials, the different processes by which fungi are able to alter wood, including decay patterns caused by white, brown, and soft-rot fungi, and fungal staining of wood. The chemical, enzymatic, and molecular aspects of the fungal attack of lignin, which represents the key step in wood decay, are also discussed. Modern analytical techniques to investigate fungal degradation and modification of the lignin polymer are reviewed, as are the different oxidative enzymes (oxidoreductases) involved in lignin degradation. These include laccases, high redox potential ligninolytic peroxidases (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), and oxidases. Special emphasis is given to the reactions catalyzed, their synergistic action on lignin, and the structural bases for their unique catalytic properties. Broadening our knowledge of lignocellulose biodegradation processes should contribute to better control of wood-decaying fungi, as well as to the development of new biocatalysts of industrial interest based on these organisms and their enzymes.},

abstract = {Litter decay rates are often correlated with the initial lignin:N or lignin:cellulose content of litter, suggesting that interactions between lignin and more labile compounds are important controls over litter decomposition. The chemical composition of lignin may influence these interactions, if lignin physically or chemically protects labile components from microbial attack. We tested the effect of lignin chemical composition on litter decay in the field during a year-long litterbag study using the model system Arabidopsis thaliana. Three Arabidopsis plant types were used, including one with high amounts of guaiacyl-type lignin, one with high aldehyde- and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignin, and a wild type control with high syringyl-type lignin. The high aldehyde litter lost significantly more mass than the other plant types, due to greater losses of cellulose, hemicellulose, and N. Aldehyde-rich lignins and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignins have low levels of cross-linking between lignins and polysaccharides, supporting the hypothesis that chemical protection of labile polysaccharides and N is a mechanism by which lignin controls total litter decay rates. 2D NMR of litters showed that lignin losses were associated with the ratio of guaiacyl-to-p-hydroxyphenyl units in lignin, because these units polymerize to form different amounts of labile- and recalcitrant-linkages within the lignin polymer. Different controls over lignin decay and polysaccharide and N decay may explain why lignin:N and lignin:cellulose ratios can be better predictors of decay rates than lignin content alone.},

abstract = {Van Soest fractionation is widely employed to characterize exogenous organic matter. The soluble fraction of Van Soest fractionation (SOL, extracted using hot water and then neutral detergent) often increases in line with compost maturity, although it is generally considered as labile. We have developed an alternative extraction method that comprises four successive steps (extraction using hot water, sodium tetraborate, dichloromethane/methanol and chelating resin) in order to clarify the chemical nature of the SOL fraction and explain its biodegradability. This method was tested on municipal solid waste compost sampled during the thermophilic phase (MSWi) and after 8 months of composting (MSWm). Both methods extracted similar proportions of organic matter. The composition of the residues was similar in MSWm although differences were noted for the extraction of polysaccharides and lipids in the case of MSWi. The hot water extractable fraction decreased during composting. Its high biodegradability in MSWi was linked to the high polysaccharide content revealed by pyrolysis-GC/MS and FTIR spectroscopy. The increase in the sodium tetraborate extractable fraction mainly explained the increase in the SOL fraction during composting. This was made up of N-containing compounds, polysaccharides and lipids in the immature compost, and a majority of N-containing compounds in the mature compost. During composting, the stabilization of organic matter in the SOL fraction extractable by sodium tetraborate and EDTA might principally involve N-containing structures through the formation of complexes of organic matter with metal ions, especially Ca(2+), which may be broken down during extraction of the Van Soest soluble fraction. These mechanisms still need to be investigated.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of leaf fibers of abaca (Musa textilis), which are commonly used for high-quality paper pulp production, was thoroughly studied. The results revealed that the lignin content was 13.2\% of the total fiber. The analysis of abaca fibers by pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) released predominantly compounds arising from lignin and p-hydroxycinnamic acids, with high amounts of 4-vinylphenol. The latter compound was demonstrated to arise from p-coumaric acid by pyrolysis of abaca fibers in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which released high amounts of p-coumaric acid (as the methyl derivative). Products from p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) propanoid units, with a predominance of the latter (H:G:S molar ratio of 1.5:1:4.9), were also released after Py-GC/MS of abaca fibers. Sinapyl and coniferyl acetates, which are thought to be lignin monomer precursors, were also found in abaca. The extractives content of the abaca fiber (0.4\%) was low, and the most predominant compounds were free sterols (24\% of total extract) and fatty acids (24\% of total extract). Additionally, significant amounts of steroid ketones (10\%), triglycerides (6\%), omega-hydroxyfatty acids (6\%), monoglycerides (4\%), fatty alcohols (4\%), and a series of p-hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) esterified with long chain alcohols and omega-hydroxyfatty acids were also found, together with minor amounts of steroid hydrocarbons, diglycerides, alpha-hydroxyfatty acids, sterol esters, and sterol glycosides.},

abstract = {Phenylpropanoid metabolism yields a mixture of monolignols that undergo chaotic, non-enzymatic reactions such as free radical polymerization and spontaneous self-assembly in order to form the polyphenolic lignin which is a barrier to cost-effective lignocellulosic biofuels. Post-synthesis lignin integration into the plant cell wall is unclear, including how the hydrophobic lignin incorporates into the wall in an initially hydrophilic milieu. Self-assembly, self-organization and aggregation give rise to a complex, 3D network of lignin that displays randomly branched topology and fractal properties. Attempts at isolating lignin, analogous to archaeology, are instantly destructive and non-representative of in planta. Lack of plant ligninases or enzymes that hydrolyze specific bonds in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) also frustrate a better grasp of lignin. Supramolecular self-assembly, nano-mechanical properties of lignin-lignin, lignin-polysaccharide interactions and association-dissociation kinetics affect biomass deconstruction and thereby cost-effective biofuels production.},

abstract = {Plant seasonal cycles alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability for soil microbes, which may affect microbial community composition and thus feed back on microbial decomposition of soil organic material and plant N availability. The temporal dynamics of these plantsoil interactions are, however, unclear. Here, we experimentally manipulated the C and N availability in a beech forest through N fertilization or tree girdling and conducted a detailed analysis of the seasonal pattern of microbial community composition and decomposition processes over 2 yr. We found a strong relationship between microbial community composition and enzyme activities over the seasonal course. Phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities were highest during late summer, whereas cellulase and protease peaked in late autumn. Girdling, and thus loss of mycorrhiza, resulted in an increase in soil organic matter-degrading enzymes and a decrease in cellulase and protease activity. Temporal changes in enzyme activities suggest a switch of the main substrate for decomposition between summer (soil organic matter) and autumn (plant litter). Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal fungi are possibly involved in autumn cellulase and protease activity. Our study shows that, through belowground C allocation, trees significantly alter soil microbial communities, which may affect seasonal patterns of decomposition processes.},

@article{Johnson2006,
abstract = {Field studies have shown that elevated CO2 can cause increased forest growth over the short term (<6 years) even in the face of N limitation. This is facilitated to some degree by greater biomass production per unit N uptake (lower tissue N concentrations), but more often than not, N uptake is increased with elevated CO2 as well. Some studies also show that N sequestration in the forest floor is increased with elevated CO2. These findings raise the questions of where the "extra" N comes from and how long such growth increases can continue without being truncated by progressive N limitation (PNL). This paper reviews some of the early nutrient cycling literature that describes PNL during forest stand development and attempts to use this information, along with recent developments in soil N research, to put the issue of PNL with elevated CO2 into perspective. Some of the early studies indicated that trees can effectively "mine" N from soils over the long term, and more recent developments in soil N cycling research suggest mechanisms by which this might have occurred. However, both the early nutrient cycling literature and more recent simulation modeling suggest that PNL will at some point truncate the observed increases in growth and nutrient uptake with elevated CO2, unless external inputs of N are increased by either N fixation or atmospheric deposition.},

abstract = {Integrating microbial physiology and biomass stoichiometry opens far-reaching possibilities for linking microbial dynamics to ecosystem processes. For example, the growth-rate hypothesis (GRH) predicts positive correlations among growth rate, RNA content, and biomass phosphorus (P) content. Such relationships have been used to infer patterns of microbial activity, resource availability, and nutrient recycling in ecosystems. However, for microorganisms it is unclear under which resource conditions the GRH applies. We developed a model to test whether the response of microbial biomass stoichiometry to variable resource stoichiometry can be explained by a trade-off among cellular components that maximizes growth. The results show mechanistically why the GRH is valid under P limitation but not under N limitation. We also show why variability of growth rate-biomass stoichiometry relationships is lower under P limitation than under N or C limitation. These theoretical results are supported by experimental data on macromolecular composition (RNA, DNA, and protein) and biomass stoichiometry from two different bacteria. In addition, compared to a model with strictly homeostatic biomass, the optimization mechanism we suggest results in increased microbial N and P mineralization during organic-matter decomposition. Therefore, this mechanism may also have important implications for our understanding of nutrient cycling in ecosystems.},

abstract = {Litter decomposition represents one of the largest annual fluxes of carbon (C) from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for tropical forests, which are generally characterized by high net primary productivity and litter turnover. We used data from the Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment (LIDET) to (1) determine the relative importance of climate and litter quality as predictors of decomposition rates, (2) compare patterns in root and leaf litter decomposition, (3) identify controls on net nitrogen (N) release during decay, and (4) compare LIDET rates with native species studies across five bioclimatically diverse neotropical forests. Leaf and root litter decomposed fastest in the lower montane rain and moist forests and slowest in the seasonally dry forest. The single best predictor of leaf litter decomposition was the climate decomposition index (CDI), explaining 51\% of the variability across all sites. The strongest models for predicting leaf decomposition combined climate and litter chemistry, and included CDI and lignin (R-2=0.69), or CDI, N and nonpolar extractives (R-2=0.69). While we found no significant differences in decomposition rates between leaf and root litter, drivers of decomposition differed for the two tissue types. Initial stages of decomposition, determined as the time to 50\% mass remaining, were driven primarily by precipitation for leaf litter (R-2=0.93) and by temperature for root litter (R-2=0.86). The rate of N release from leaf litter was positively correlated with initial N concentrations; net N immobilization increased with decreasing initial N concentrations. This study demonstrates that decomposition is sensitive to climate within and across tropical forests. Our results suggest that climate change and increasing N deposition in tropical forests are likely to result in significant changes to decomposition rates in this biome.},

abstract = {Production of lignin peroxidases by Phanerochaete chrysosposorium in a submerged stirred tank reactor is affected by certain critical parameters, some of which have been investigated in the present paper. These factors are: inoculum, pellet size, certain organic compounds such as polypropylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, culture conditions and composition. A rich inoculum results in formation of small pellets, fast depletion of glucose, and no production of lignin peroxidase. Reduced inoculum size prolongs the development of the culture followed by an active so-called secondary phase. The activity of the culture, however, is just enough to decolorize the blue color of Remazol dye but not strong enough to show extracellular lignin peroxidase. The presence of polypropylene glycol (PPG), polyethylene glycol (PEG) or hexadecane in the culture activates the culture towards lignin peroxidase production. The favorable effect of PPG exists only in cultures made up with tap water and reduced inoculum size at pH 4.5. Trace elements but not vitamins may be left out of the medium without impairing lignin peroxidase-producing ability. The use of desalinated water leads not only to the absence of lignin peroxidase production but also to retardation in growth of the fungi, emphasizing the need for a systematic investigation of the culture medium. The experiments were conducted in a 42 l stirred tank reactor and scaled up to 300 l reactor. Constant impeller tip speed and constant gas flow rate are not sufficient criteria for upscaling of this system.},

abstract = {Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants exhibit a complex interplay between CO2 fixation by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco), and carbon demand for CAM maintenance and growth. This study investigated the flux of carbon from PEPC and direct Rubisco fixation to different leaf carbon pools and to phloem sap over the diurnal cycle. Concentrations and carbon isotope compositions of starch, soluble sugars, and organic acids were determined in leaves and phloem exudates of Kalancho daigremontiana Hamet et Perr., and related to CO2 fixation by PEPC and Rubisco. Three types of leaf carbon pools could be distinguished. (i) Starch and malate pools were dominant and showed a pattern of reciprocal mobilization and accumulation (85/54 and 13/48 mg C g1 DW, respective, at the beginning/end of phase I). The carbon isotope composition of these pools was compatible with predominant PEPC fixation ( 13C values of 13 and 11 for starch and malate compared to 11 of PEPC fixed carbon). (ii) Isotopic composition (17 and 14) and concentration of glucose and fructose (2 and 3 mg C g1 DW, respectively) were not affected by diurnal metabolism, suggesting a low turnover. (iii) Sucrose (13 mg C g1 DW), in contrast, exhibited large diurnal changes in 13C values (from 17 in the evening to 12 in the morning), which were not matched by net changes in sucrose concentration. This suggests a high sucrose turnover, fed by nocturnal starch degradation and direct Rubisco fixation during the day. A detailed dissection of the carbon fixation and mobilization pattern in K. daigremontiana revealed that direct fixation of Rubisco during the light accounted for 30\% of phloem sucrose, but only 15\% of fixed carbon, indicating that carbon from direct Rubisco fixation was preferentially used for leaf export.},

abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation.

abstract = {The strength and generality of the relationship between decomposition rates and detritus carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations was assessed by comparing published reports of decomposition rates of detritus of photosynthetic organisms, from unicellular algae to trees. The results obtained demonstrated the existence of a general positive, linear relationship between plant decomposition rates and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Differences in the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations of plant detritus accounted for 89\% of the variance in plant decomposition rates of detritus orginating from photosynthetic organisms ranging from unicellular microalgae to trees. The results also demonstrate that moist plant material decomposes substantially faster than dry material with similar nutrient concentrations. Consideration of lignin, instead of carbon, concentrations did not improve the relationships obtained. These results reflect the coupling of phosphorus and nitrogen in the basic biochemical processes of both plants and their microbial decomposers, and stress the importance of this coupling for carbon and nutrient flow in ecosystems.},

These two LCSs were examined in the present work by spectroscopic and pyrolytic methods (solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) (13)C NMR, XPS, conventional Curie pyrolysis (Cupy)/GC/MS, and TMAH thermochemolysis/GC/MS). This combined study highlighted the limitation of some of the above methods when applied to ligno-cellulosic materials and the resulting biases and the usefulness of TMAH thermochemolysis. A large difference in composition was observed between bran- and straw-LCS due to a much higher contribution of alkyl moieties in the former. These moieties correspond to fatty acids esterified to the ligno-cellulosic macromolecular structure and such carboxylic functions should play an important role for metal complexation.},

abstract = {The Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL) hypothesis suggests that ecosystems in a CO2-enriched atmosphere will sequester C and N in long-lived biomass and soil organic pools, thereby limiting available N and constraining the continued response of net primary productivity to elevated [CO2]. Here, we present a six-year record of N dynamics of a sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) stand exposed to elevated [CO2] in the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We also evaluate the concept of PNL for this ecosystem from the perspective of N uptake, content, distribution, and turnover, and N-use efficiency. Leaf N content was 11\% lower on a leaf mass basis (NM) and 7\% lower on a leaf area basis (NA) in CO2-enriched trees. However, there was no effect of [CO2] on total canopy N content. Resorption of N during senescence was not altered by [CO2], so NM of litter, but not total N content, was reduced. The NM of fine roots was not affected, but the total amount of N required for fine-root production increased significantly, reflecting the large stimulation of fine-root production in this stand. Hence, total N requirement of the trees was higher in elevated [CO2], and the increased requirement was met through an increase in N uptake rather than increased retranslocation of stored reserves. Increased N uptake was correlated with increased net primary productivity (NPP). N-use efficiency, however, did not change with CO2 enrichment because increased N productivity was offset by lower mean residence time of N in the trees. None of the measured responses of plant N dynamics in this ecosystem indicated the occurrence of PNL, and the stimulation of NPP by elevated [CO2] was sustained for the first six years of the experiment. Although there are some indications of developing changes in the N economy, the N supply in the soil at this site may be sufficient to meet an increasing demand for available N, especially as the roots of CO2-enriched trees explore deeper in the soil profile.},

abstract = {Fungi and bacteria are key players in the decomposition of leaf litter, but their individual contributions to the process and their interactions are still poorly known. We combined semi-quantitative proteome analyses (1-D PAGE-LC-MS/MS) with qualitative and quantitative analyses of extracellular degradative enzyme activities to unravel the respective roles of a fungus and a bacterium during litter decomposition. Two model organisms, a mesophilic Gram-negative bacterium (Pectobacterium carotovorum) and an ascomycete (Aspergillus nidulans), were grown in both, pure culture and co-culture on minimal medium containing either glucose or beech leaf litter as sole carbon source. P. carotovorum grew best in co-culture with the fungus, whereas growth of A. nidulans was significantly reduced when the bacterium was present. This observation suggests that P. carotovorum has only limited capabilities to degrade leaf litter and profits from the degradation products of A. nidulans at the expense of fungal growth. In accordance with this interpretation, our proteome analysis revealed that most of the extracellular biodegradative enzymes (i.e. proteases, pectinases, and cellulases) in the cultures with beech litter were expressed by the fungus, the bacterium producing only low levels of pectinases.},

Litter was collected from 20 common oak (Quercus robur L.) stands in Wales (UK) and placed in litter-decomposition bags. These bags were installed in an oak stand for 3, 6, 12, 21, and 31 months to study the effect of litter quality on decomposition (mass loss) rates and the limit value for a broad-leaf species. Results indicate that the initial decomposition rate is highly correlated with the manganese content of the litter (P = 0.007, R2 = 0.34). In the final stages of decomposition, limit values ranged between 57\% and 95\% of initial litter mass. These estimated limit values were not significantly correlated with initial concentrations of other nutrients. However, Ca concentrations gave a significance level of P = 0.067. Estimated rates of C sequestration in soil ranged from 0.93 to 80.22 g Cm2year1.},

abstract = {The chemical transformations that occur during growth of the shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) on oak (Quercus alba) were investigated to improve mushroom cultivation and utilization of the spent substrate. Oak logs were decayed by L. edodes over 8 years, during which time they were sampled at six intervals (30, 40, 66, 76, 77, and 101 months). Fresh and decayed oak samples were analyzed using solid-state (13)C NMR and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as off-line thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Degraded oak exhibited lower carbon contents and increased oxygen content compared to the control. Solid-state (13)C NMR analysis revealed that polysaccharides were the major component of both fresh and decayed oak but that L. edodes mediated the preferential loss of cellulose and xylans as compared to lignin, which remained in an altered form. Several trends point toward the degradation of lignin, including a decrease in the proportion of syringyl units as compared to guaiacyl units and a reduction in side-chain length. An increase in guaiacyl and syringyl acid-to-aldehyde ratios occurred with growth, which suggested that the fungus had caused oxidation of Calpha-Cbeta bonds. The overall effect of L. edodes on oak is similar to that of many white-rot fungi, which simultaneously degrade all cell wall components.},

abstract = {The flow of carbon and nutrients from plant production into detrital food webs is mediated by microbial enzymes released into the environment (ecoenzymes). Ecoenzymatic activities are linked to both microbial metabolism and environmental resource availability. In this paper, we extend the theoretical and empirical framework for ecoenzymatic stoichiometry from nutrient availability to carbon composition by relating ratios of $\beta$-1,4-glucosidase (BG), acid (alkaline) phosphatase (AP), $\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and phenol oxidase (POX) activities in soils to measures of organic matter recalcitrance, using data from 28 ecosystems. BG and POX activities are uncorrelated even though both are required for lignocellulose degradation. However, the ratio of BG:POX activity is negatively correlated with the relative abundance of recalcitrant carbon. Unlike BG, POX activity is positively correlated with (NAG + LAP) and AP activities. We propose that the effect of organic matter recalcitrance on microbial C:N and C:P threshold element ratios (TER) can be represented by normalizing BG, AP and (NAG + LAP) activities to POX activity. The scaling relationships among these ratios indicate that the increasing recalcitrance of decomposing organic matter effectively reverses the growth rate hypothesis of stoichiometric theory by decreasing carbon and nutrient availability and slowing growth, which increases TERN:P. This effect is consistent with the narrow difference between the mean elemental C:N ratios of soil organic matter and microbial biomass and with the inhibitory effect of N enrichment on rates of decomposition and microbial metabolism for recalcitrant organic matter. From these findings, we propose a conceptual framework for bottom-up decomposition models that integrate the stoichiometry of ecoenzymatic activities into general theories of ecology.},

abstract = {We show the potentiality of coupling together different compound-specific isotopic analyses in a laboratory experiment, where (13)C-depleted leaf litter was incubated on a (13)C-enriched soil. The aim of our study was to identify the soil compounds where the C derived from three different litter species is retained. Three (13)C-depleted leaf litter (Liquidambar styraciflua L., Cercis canadensis L. and Pinus taeda L., delta(13)C(vsPDB) approximately -43 per thousand), differing in their degradability, were incubated on a C4 soil (delta(13)C(vsPDB) approximately -18 per thousand) under laboratory-controlled conditions for 8 months. At harvest, compound-specific isotope analyses were performed on different classes of soil compounds [i.e. phospholipids fatty acids (PLFAs), n-alkanes and soil pyrolysis products]. Linoleic acid (PLFA 18:2omega6,9) was found to be very depleted in (13)C (delta(13)C(vsPDB) approximately from -38 to -42 per thousand) compared to all other PLFAs (delta(13)C(vsPDB) approximately from -14 to -35 per thousand). Because of this, fungi were identified as the first among microbes to use the litter as source of C. Among n-alkanes, long-chain (C27-C31) n-alkanes were the only to have a depleted delta(13)C. This is an indication that not all of the C derived from litter in the soil was transformed by microbes. The depletion in (13)C was also found in different classes of pyrolysis products, suggesting that the litter-derived C is incorporated in less or more chemically stable compounds, even only after 8 months decomposition.},

abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) dating of total soil organic matter (SOM) often yields results inconsistent with the stratigraphic sequence. The onerous chemical extractions for SOM fractions do not always produce satisfactory 14C dates. In an effort to develop an alternative method, the pyrolysis-combustion technique was investigated to partition SOM into pyrolysis volatile (Py-V) and pyrolysis residue (Py-R) fractions. The Py-V fractions obtained from a thick glacigenic loess succession in Illinois yielded 14C dates much younger but more reasonable than the counterpart Py-R fractions for the soil residence time. Carbon isotopic composition 13C) was heavier in the Py-V fractions, suggesting a greater abundance of carbohydrate- and protein-related constituents, and 13C was lighter in the Py-R fractions, suggesting more ligninand lipid-related constituents. The combination of 14C dates and 13C values indicates that the Py-V fractions are less biodegradation resistant and the Py-R fractions are more biodegradation resistant. The pyrolysis-combustion method provides a less cumbersome approach for 14C dating of SOM fractions. With further study, this method may become a useful tool for analyzing unlithified terrestrial sediments when macrofossils are absent.},

Oven-dried samples were used to eliminate the influence of initial water. Demineralized samples (prepared by acid washing) were also used to determine the influence of the minerals contained in the wood samples.

@article{Schulten1998,
abstract = {1. From the data presented herein it is possible to deduce the following distribution of total N in humic substances and soils: proteinaceous materials (proteins, peptides, and amino acids) - ca. 40\%; amino sugars - 5-6\%; heterocyclic N compounds (including purines and pyrimidines) - ca. 35\%; NH3 -19\%; approximately 1/4 of the NH3 is fixed NH4+. Thus, proteinaceous materials and heterocyclics appear to be major soil N components. 2. Natural 15N abundance levels in soils and humic materials are so low that direct analysis by 15N NMR is very difficult or impossible. To overcome this difficulty, the soil or humic material is incubated with 15N-enriched fertilizer. Even incubation in the laboratory for up to 630 days does not produce the same types of 15N compounds that are formed in soils and humic materials over hundreds or thousands of years. For example, very few 15N-labelled heterocyclics are detected by 15N NMR. Does this mean that heterocyclics are not present? Or are the heterocyclics that are present not labelled under these experimental conditions and therefore not detected by the 15N NMR spectrometer? Another possibility is that a large number of N heterocyclics occur in soils, but each type occurs in very low concentrations. Until the sensitivity is improved, 15N NMR will not provide results that can be compared with data obtained from the same soil and humic material samples by chemical methods and mass spectroscopy. 3. What is most important with respect to agricultural is that all major N forms in soils are available to organisms and are sources of NH3 or NH4+ for plant roots and microbes. Naturally, some of the NH3 will enter the N cycle. 4. From chemical and pyrolysis-mass spectrometric analyses it appears that N heterocylics are significant components of the SOM, rather than degradation products of other molecules due to pyrolysis. The arguments in favor of N heterocyclics as genuine SOM components are the following: a) Some N-heterocyclics originate from biological precursors of SOM, such as proteinaceous materials, carbohydrates, chlorophyll, nucleic acids, and alkaloids, which enter the soil system as plant residues or remains of animals. b) In aquatic humic substances and dissolved organic matter (DOM) at considerably lower pyrolysis temperatures (200 to 300C), free and substituted N-heterocyclics such as pyrroles, pyrrolidines, pyridines, pyranes, and pyrazoles, have been identified by analytical pyrolysis (Schulten et al 1997b). c) Their presence in humic substances and soils was also detected without pyrolysis by gel chromatography - GC/MS after reductive acetylation (Schnitzer and Spiteller 1986), by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Patience et al. 1992), and also by spectroscopic, chromatographic, chemical, and isotopic methods (Ikan et al. 1992). 5. While we can see light at the end of the tunnel as far as soil-N is concerned, further research is needed to identify additional N-containing compounds such as N-heterocyclics, to determine whether these are present in the soil or humic materials in the form in which they were identified or whether they originate from more complex structures. If the latter is correct, then we need to isolate these complex N-molecules and attempt to identify them.},

abstract = {A multi-site and multi-age set of in situ N-15-labelled litter decomposition experiments was carried out in various European beech forests. The sites presented contrasted situations of climate and humus type that were representative of northern Europe temperate forests. N-15-labelled leaf litter was produced by urea spraying in an experimental beech plot, and was used in litter decomposition experiments over a 3-6-year period, depending on the site. Schemes of decomposition covered a wide range of situations, some of them not expected, like high decay rate on Moder humus forms or slow decomposition on Mull humus form. The objectives of this study were to determine how nitrogen release and/or incorporation rates could characterize litter decomposition dynamics. A carbon and nitrogen coupled model of decomposition based on the quality theory was used to fit the given data. High correlation coefficients and unbiased fitting were obtained both for carbon (R-2 = 0.96,p \&lt;= 0.0001, n = 392) and nitrogen (R-2 = 0.86,p \&lt;= 0.0001, n = 367). The theoretical concept of quality was somewhat lightened and related to decomposer activity: low rates of quality decrease were associated with high decomposition rates, showing that when decomposers are sufficiently supplied with labile carbon from the humus they decompose litter more completely than when they are carbon limited. Provided that the degrading substrate stoichiometry was kept constant (i.e. C loss / N loss ratio), the same litter decomposition could be processed at different rates. Taking seasonal variations of the parameters into account is likely to improve our understanding, but further experiments at more frequent intervals are needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We characterized a slow (Dicranopteris linearis) and fast-decomposing species (Cheirodendron trigynum) and surface (O), and subsurface (A-horizon) SOM beneath each species using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), with and without derivatization. The live tissues of Dicranopteris had greater lignin content whereas Cheirodendron had a greater lipid, N-bearing, and polysaccharide component. Despite this difference in leaf chemistry, SOM chemistry was similar between soil aggregate fractions, but different between horizons. The O-horizon contained primarily lignin and polysaccharide biomarkers whereas the A-horizon contained polysaccharide, aromatic, and N-derived compounds, indicating considerable microbial processing of plant litter. The soils beneath Cheirodendron inherited a greater lipid signal composed of cutin and suberin biomarkers whereas the soils beneath Dicranopteris contained greater aromatic biomarker content, possibly derived from plant lignins. The soils beneath both species were more similar to root polysaccharides, lipids, and lignins than aboveground tissue. This study indicates that although plant-derived OM is processed vigorously, species-specific biomarkers and compound class differences persist into these soils and that differences in plant chemical properties may influence soil development even after considerable reworking of plant litter by microorganisms.},

Similar phenolic compounds were found in the sound and extensively degraded wood, as well as in wood samples collected in R-zone, which separate sound and decayed wood. Significant variation of S/G ratio versus wood degradation, instead, was observed. The values showed a decrease of 27.1\% from sound to decayed wood revealing a structural fungal degradation of lignin. Furthermore, a less extensive drop (13.7\%) of S/G ratio in the R-zone, in comparison with the sound wood, was observed. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the relative peak areas of the 23 identified pyrolysis products. The differentiation between sound and decayed wood was observed in the plot of the two first components as well as the correlation between pyrolysis products was discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

We found a strong degree of cross-landscape dominance by a subset of species whose identities were predictable from sapling survivorship rates under shade. Using canonical ordination we found that spatial and environmental–historical factors were of comparable importance for controlling within-landscape variability in species composition. Past land use had a strong impact on species composition despite ceasing 100–200 years ago. Furthermore, edaphic–hydrological factors, treefall gaps, ...},

@article{Rub2007,
abstract = {During microbial breakdown of leaf litter a fraction of the C lost by the litter is not released to the atmosphere as CO(2) but remains in the soil as microbial byproducts. The amount of this fraction and the factors influencing its size are not yet clearly known. We performed a laboratory experiment to quantify the flow of C from decaying litter into the soil, by means of stable C isotopes, and tested its dependence on litter chemical properties. Three sets of (13)C-depleted leaf litter (Liquidambar styraciflua L., Cercis canadensis L. and Pinus taeda L.) were incubated in the laboratory in jars containing (13)C-enriched soil (i.e. formed C4 vegetation). Four jars containing soil only were used as a control. Litter chemical properties were measured using thermogravimetry (Tg) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-combustion interface-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS-C-IRMS). The respiration rates and the delta(13)C of the respired CO(2) were measured at regular intervals. After 8 months of incubation, soils incubated with both L. styraciflua and C. canadensis showed a significant change in delta(13)C (delta(13)C(final) = -20.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand and -19.5 +/- 0.5 per thousand, respectively) with respect to the initial value (delta(13)C(initial) = -17.7 +/- 0.3 per thousand); the same did not hold for soil incubated with P. taeda (delta(13)C(final:)-18.1 +/- 0.5 per thousand). The percentages of litter-derived C in soil over the total C loss were not statistically different from one litter species to another. This suggests that there is no dependence of the percentage of C input into the soil (over the total C loss) on litter quality and that the fractional loss of leaf litter C is dependent only on the microbial assimilation efficiency. The percentage of litter-derived C in soil was estimated to be 13 +/- 3\% of total C loss.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. A better understanding of the global relationship between environmental characteristics, ecosystems and SOM chemistry is vital in order to assess its specific influence on carbon cycles. This study compared the composition of extracted SOM in 18 topsoil samples taken under tundra, taiga, steppe, temperate forest and tropical forest using pyrolysis-GC/MS. Results indicate that SOM from cold climates (tundra, taiga) still resembles the composition of litter, evidenced by high quantities of levosugars and long alkanes relative to N-compounds and a clear odd-over-even dominance of the longer alkanes. Under temperate conditions, increased microbial degradation generally results in a more altered SOM chemistry. SOM formed under temperate coniferous forests shows an accumulation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties, probably induced by substrate limitations. Tropical SOM was characterized by an SOM composition rich in N-compounds and low in lignins, without any accumulation of recalcitrant fractions (i.e. aliphatic and aromatic compounds). Lignin composition moreover varies according to vegetation type. Results were validated against 13 new samples. The humic signature of topsoil organic matter formed under different biomes indicates a dominating effect of (i) SOM input composition related to vegetation, and (ii) SOM breakdown reflecting both climate and input quality. No evidence was found for a chemically stabilized SOM fraction under favorable decomposition conditions (temperate or warm climate with broadleaved vegetation). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Finzi2006,
abstract = {A hypothesis for progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) proposes that net primary production (NPP) will decline through time in ecosystems subjected to a step-function increase in atmospheric CO2. The primary mechanism driving this response is a rapid rate of N immobilization by plants and microbes under elevated CO2 that depletes soils of N, causing slower rates of N mineralization. Under this hypothesis, there is little long-term stimulation of NPP by elevated CO2 in the absence of exogenous inputs of N. We tested this hypothesis using data on the pools and fluxes of C and N in tree biomass, microbes, and soils from 1997 through 2002 collected at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. Elevated CO2 stimulated NPP by 18-24\% during the first six years of this experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis for PNL, significantly more N was immobilized in tree biomass and in the O horizon under elevated CO2. In contrast to the PNL hypothesis, microbial-N immobilization did not increase under elevated CO2, and although the rate of net N mineralization declined through time, the decline was not significantly more rapid under elevated CO2. Ecosystem C-to-N ratios widened more rapidly under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 indicating a more rapid rate of C fixation per unit of N, a processes that could delay PNL in this ecosystem. Mass balance calculations demonstrated a large accrual of ecosystem N capital. Is PNL occurring in this ecosystem and will NPP decline to levels under ambient CO2? The answer depends on the relative strength of tree biomass and O-horizon N immobilization vs. widening C-to-N ratios and ecosystem-N accrual as processes that drive and delay PNL, respectively. Only direct observations through time will definitively answer this question.},

abstract = {The lignin biosynthetic pathway has been studied for more than a century but has undergone major revisions over the past decade. Significant progress has been made in cloning new genes by genetic and combined bioinformatics and biochemistry approaches. In vitro enzymatic assays and detailed analyses of mutants and transgenic plants altered in the expression of lignin biosynthesis genes have provided a solid basis for redrawing the monolignol biosynthetic pathway, and structural analyses have shown that plant cell walls can tolerate large variations in lignin content and structure. In some cases, the potential value for agriculture of transgenic plants with modified lignin structure has been demonstrated. This review presents a current picture of monolignol biosynthesis, polymerization, and lignin structure.},

abstract = {Changes in the lignin fraction of spruce and pine needle litter were followed by four different methods: Klason lignin, phloroglucinol lignin, dioxane-water-HCl-lignin and alkaline CuO oxidation. The decomposition patterns of the lignins studied were different, the largest differences between the methods being obtained for the spruce needles. Depending on the method used, between 36 and 46\% of the original amount of lignin remained in the pine needles and about 30–61\% in the spruce needles after 3 yr of decomposition. The decomposition rates of the various lignin pools were highly correlated with the loss in mass of the litter. The phloroglucinol lignin was decomposed significantly faster (P < 0.001) in the spruce needles than in the pine needles for as long as the decomposition process was followed. During decomposition of the litter, the residual amount of Klason lignin was correlated with the residual amounts of the other lignins. The application of the different methods to litter decomposition studies is discussed.},

@article{Martinez2011,
abstract = {Selective modification/degradation of the main plant polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) was investigated in a hardwood after white and brown-rot fungal decay under environmental conditions. The chemical changes produced in the plant cell wall were analysed in situ, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the gel state, and analytical pyrolysis. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR of the white-rotted wood showed only cellulose and (deacetylated) hemicellulose, and the complete removal of lignin. On the other hand, the brown-rotted wood showed the nearly complete absence of polysaccharides, while the main features of lignin structure, as revealed by 2D-NMR, could be observed. These included well-resolved aromatic and side-chain cross-signals, although the intensity of the latter signals was lowered indicating a reduction in the number of side-chain linkages ($\beta$-O-4' and $\beta$-$\beta$') per aromatic unit (their relative abundances remaining unchanged). These results contrast with a recent study concluding that the aromatic polymer after brown-rot decay is not longer recognized as lignin. Some oxidative alteration of lignin during brown-rot decay was evidenced and, more interesting, several compounds with 3-methoxycatechol skeleton were released upon pyrolysis. Lignin demethylation is consistent with recent brown-rot transcriptomic/secretomic studies showing overexpression of methanol oxidase, which could use lignin-derived methanol to generate the peroxide required for cellulose depolymerization via Fenton chemistry.},

abstract = {This study centred on the analysis of lignin in situ of cloned eucalypt and pine kraft pulps. Trametes versicolor laccase-viol uric acid system (LMS) delignifications were performed on a softwood (Pinus pinaster) and a hardwood (Eucalyptus globulus) conventional kraft pulp with an initial kappa number of 34.5 and 15.5, respectively. The LMS treated pulps were then subjected to alkaline extraction stages (E). The kappa number data show that LMS is effective at biodelignifying both softwood and hardwood kraft pulps. However, under the conditions employed in this study, a greater level of biodelignification was obtained with LMS E. globulus (hardwood) than with LMS P. pinaster (softwood), but the amount of lignin removed was higher for the softwood pulp. The original milled wood samples, kraft pulps, biodelignified kraft pulps, and isolated residual lignin and milled wood lignins from the two wood samples have been characterized by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The analysis of the pyrograms indicates that the lignin compositions of the two wood species and corresponding pulps are very different, as expected; however, the knowledge of the chemical mechanisms of delignification is very limited and requires additional work. Analytical pyrolysis is one the few degradative methods for the analysis of biopolymers that has shown a sufficient degree of success. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examined the rates of lignin decay (dC3/dt) and holocellulose decay (dC2/dt) in aboveground leaf litter of predominately northern conifer forests to test our hypothesis that the rate of lignin decay is a linear function of the lignocellulose index (LCI = lignin/[lignin + holocellulose]). We proposed that lignin decays only when LCI > 0.4 and that LCI cannot exceed 0.7, approximating humus. These constraints suggest that holocellulose content of litter is a control on lignin decay. We evaluated this hypothesis with a set of 112 field studies in two ways, by: (1) comparing simulations from a decomposition model to observations across the full range of litter decay and (2) analyzing the relative rate of lignin decay ([dC3/dt]/[dC2/dt + dC3/dt]) as a function of litter LCI. Simulated dynamics of LCI in decaying litter were highly correlated to observed patterns, particularly when litter fractions of water and ethanol solubles from model output were pooled with holocellulose fractions (mean R2 = 0.87 ± 0.02, P < 0.01). More detailed analyses of 64 of these studies yielded variable relationships between lignin decay rate and litter LCI; a regression based on pooled data (N = 385; total number of observations) from these studies produced a slope and an intercept that were not significantly different from predicted (slope = 2.33, intercept = −0.93). Both site and litter characteristics had significant effects on the proposed LCI threshold for lignin decay (LCI  0.4), but no effects on slope or intercept, suggesting that the proposed lignocellulose control hypothesis is relatively robust across a range of litter and forest types used in this study.},

abstract = {A collection of tannins extracted from various plant species was subjected to thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The products obtained included 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes, derived from A rings of condensed tannins (CTs), and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, and derivatives as major products from the B ring. 1,2,4-Tri- and two tetramethoxybenzenes were also detected in most analyses. Correlation analyses revealed that they were derived from the B ring, with 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene being derived from a procyanidin (PC) B ring and 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxybenzene from a prodelphinidin (PD) ring. Tannins from species that contained both CT and hydrolyzable tannin (HT) produced mainly permethylated gallic acid moieties upon THM, and the products derived from CTs were less abundant. Most likely, the ester-bound HTs are more easily transmethylated than the cleavage and methylation of the C-C and C-O linked CTs. Statistical analyses of the THM products and 13C NMR data of the tannins showed good correlations between the B ring hydroxylation and the di- and trimethoxybenzenes observed. Using the ratio of the methyl esters of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid only provided good correlations of the percent PC as well. Furthermore, the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes may serve as good markers of tannins in plant, soil, sediment or other samples as analyzed by THM.},

abstract = {Fungi and bacteria are key agents in plant litter decomposition in freshwater ecosystems. However, the specific roles of these two groups and their interactions during the decomposition process are unclear. We compared the growth and patterns of degradative enzymes expressed by communities of bacteria and fungi grown separately and in coexistence on Phragmites leaves. The two groups displayed both synergistic and antagonistic interactions. Bacteria grew better together with fungi than alone. In addition, there was a negative effect of bacteria on fungi, which appeared to be caused by suppression of fungal growth and biomass accrual rather than specifically affecting enzyme activity. Fungi growing alone had a high capacity for the decomposition of plant polymers such as lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. In contrast, enzyme activities were in general low when bacteria grew alone, and the activity of key enzymes in the degradation of lignin and cellulose (phenol oxidase and cellobiohydrolase) was undetectable in the bacteria-only treatment. Still, biomass-specific activities of most enzymes were higher in bacteria than in fungi. The low total activity and growth of bacteria in the absence of fungi in spite of apparent high enzymatic efficiency during the degradation of many substrates suggest that fungi provide the bacteria with resources that the bacteria were not able to acquire on their own, most probably intermediate decomposition products released by fungi that could be used by bacteria.},

abstract = {The phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers 18:1 9, 18:2 6,9 and 18:3 3,6,9 are commonly used as fungal biomarkers in soils. They have, however, also been found to occur in plant tissues, such as roots. Thus, the use of these PLFAs as fungal biomarkers in sieved soil, which may still contain small remains of roots, has been questioned. We used data from a recent beech tree girdling experiment to calculate the contribution of roots to these biomarkers and were able to demonstrate that not more than 0.61\% of 18:1 9 and 18:2 6,9 in sieved soil samples originated from roots (but 4\% of 18:3 3,6,9). Additionally, the abundance of the biomarker 18:2 6,9 in the soil was found to be highly correlated to ectomycorrhizal root colonization, which further corroborates its fungal origin. PLFA biomarkers were substantially reduced in vital roots from girdled trees compared to roots of control trees (by up to 76\%), indicating that the major part of PLFAs measured in roots may actually originate from ectomycorrhizal fungi growing inside the roots. Wecalculated, that even a near to 50\% reduction in fine root biomass as observed in the girdling treatment accounted for only 0.8\% of the measured decrease of 18:2 6,9. Our results demonstrate thatboth 18:1 9 and 18:2 6,9 are suitable biomarkers for detecting fungal dynamics in soils and that especially 18:2 6,9 is a reliable biomarker to study mycorrhizal dynamics in beech forests.},

abstract = {Conventional pyrolysis-GC-MS, thermochemolysis and alkaline CuO oxidation were applied to determine differences between dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial plants, soil horizons and drinking water reservoirs in two catchments in South Australia. These two reservoir-catchment systems were selected on the basis of contrasting vegetation and land use. Pyrolysis of DOM yielded furans, aliphatic products and N-containing compounds, which are indicative of polysaccharides, lipids and proteins, respectively. Thermochemolysis enabled detection of methoxy-benzyl compounds derived from various sources of DOM, indicating that these compounds can be used as bio-markers of vascular plant sources. Vanillic acid was detected from DOM isolates from the vegetation, soils and reservoir waters of the two catchments, using CuO oxidation, and hence this compound also appears to be a suitable bio-marker for tracing allochthonous DOM input into the reservoirs. Each of the three techniques resulted in the formation of different compounds from the DOM isolates, which indicated the type of precursor bio-polymer and/or some of the methoxyphenol structures of lignin.},

abstract = {We used sugar maple litter double-labeled with C-13 and N-15 to quantify fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) between litter and soil in a northern hardwood forest and the retention of litter C and N in soil. Two cohorts of litter were compared, one in which the label was preferentially incorporated into non-structural tissue and the other structural tissue. Loss of C-13 from this litter generally followed dry mass and total C loss whereas loss of N-15 (20-30\% in 1 year) was accompanied by large increases of total N content of this decaying litter (26-32\%). Enrichment of C-13 and N-15 was detected in soil down to 10-15 cm depth. After 6 months of decay (November-May) 36-43\% of the C-13 released from the litter was recovered in the soil, with no differences between the structural and non-structural labeled litter. By October the percentage recovery of litter C-13 in soil was much lower (16\%). The C released from litter and remaining in soil organic matter (SOM) after 1 year represented over 30 g C m(-2) y(-1) of SOM accumulation. Recovery of litter N-15 in soil was much higher than for C (over 90\%) and in May N-15 was mostly in organic horizons whereas by October it was mostly in 0-10 cm mineral soil. A small proportion of this N was recovered as inorganic N (2-6\%). Recovery of N-15 in microbial biomass was higher in May (13-15\%) than in October (about 5\%). The C:N ratio of the SOM and microbial biomass derived from the labeled litter was much higher for the structural than the non-structural litter and for the forest floor than mineral SOM, illustrating the interactive role of substrates and microbial activity in regulating the C:N stoichiometry of forest SOM formation. These results for a forest ecosystem long exposed to chronically high atmospheric N deposition (ca. 10 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) suggest possible mechanisms of N retention in soil: increased organic N leaching from fresh litter and reduced fungal transport of N from soil to decaying litter may promote N stabilization in mineral SOM even at a relatively low C:N ratio.},

abstract = {Each plant species has a unique chemical composition, and also within a given plant the various tissues differ from one another in their chemistry. These different compositions can be traced back after decay of the plant parts when they are transformed into soil organic matter (SOM). As a result, the composition of SOM reflects not only the plant origin, but also the various tissues, and the composition consequently provides an estimate of the contribution of above-ground vs. below-ground litter. From the latter distribution the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Application of thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) releases all typical cutin- and suberin-derived aliphatic monomers (mono-, di- and trihydroxyalkanoic acids, alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) as their methyl esters and/or ethers in a rapid manner. Using the distribution of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids that are present in pine needle cutin (C(12) and C(14)) and not in root suberin, and those that are present in roots but not in needles (C(20) and C(22)), the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground plant litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Similarly, the (9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid+9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid)/(C(20) + C(22) alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) ratio reflects the degree of bioturbation. Three mineral soil profiles under Corsican pine with an A horizon that exhibited extensive bioturbation phenomena, and underlying C horizons with hardly any or no bioturbation, were investigated in order to examine the applicability of such an approach. It appeared that the A horizons contained all four mentioned omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids, while the C horizons contained virtually only the C(20) and C(22) members. The results not only suggest that bioturbation occurs in the A horizons, but also that possible illuviation or other transport mechanisms of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids seem hardly ever or never to occur, which is a prerequisite for applying this biomarker approach in assessing degrees of bioturbation.},

abstract = {The pyrolysis of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) of the cultivar, "Cave-in-Rock" harvested at three stages of physiological maturity was studied in a PY-GC/MS system at the 600-1050 degrees C temperature range. Under these conditions, the decomposition was complete within 20 s yielding char, and two sets of pyrolysis gas, condensable and non-condensable. The former consisted of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and higher molecular weight compounds possibly from the hydroxyl group and from the methoxy groups of the cell wall components. The non-condensable gases were mainly CO, CO2 and C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons. For these, there was a 900 degrees C temperature boundary where dramatic change occurred in their evolution rates. Below this temperature, CO2 decreased but CO and the C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons increased almost linearly with temperature. Above this temperature boundary, the hydrocarbons leveled off but there was a rapid rise in CO and CO2 evolution at a constant CO/CO2 ratio. These suggest the appearance of secondary or tertiary pyrolysis reactions involving rearrangement and release of CO and hydrocarbons prior to this temperature boundary and the release of CO and CO2 from the tightly bond oxygen functionalities including C-C bonds thereafter. At \&lt;750 degrees C, there were modest increases in condensable gas yield and decrease in non-condensable gas due to differences in plant maturity at harvest. However, the effect of switchgrass physiological maturity on gas yield was statistically insignificant at high temperatures. The energy content of the non-condensable gas measured was about 68\% of the gross energy content of the biomass for the early harvest crop and 80\% for the mature crop. The activation energy for the decomposition, estimated assuming first order reaction kinetics, showed a linear increase with plant physiological maturity. The results demonstrate that physiological maturity at harvest of switchgrass biomass can result in different concentrations of pyrolysis products at different temperatures. These results also demonstrate the need for additional research with a broader array of herbaceous biomass materials to develop a better understanding of the synergies of crop cultivation, harvesting and processing of dedicated herbaceous biomass energy crops during their thermochemical conversion.

abstract = {Changes in organic composition of crop residues (soybean, radish, white lupine, blue lupine, black oat and mucuna) that are utilized in crop rotations in no-tillage farming systems in the southern part of Brazil were evaluated by analytical flash. pyrolysis. The pyrolysis allowed the identification of five groups of compounds ill the residues: guaiacyl moieties in lignin (Lg), syringyl moities in lignin (Ls), polysaccharide (Ps), chlorophyll (Chl) and fatty acid (Fa) derivatives. The decomposition :rates of the plant residues ranged from 4.7 to 5.9 g kg(-1) day(-1), with a mean value of 5.2 g kg(-1) day(-1), corresponding to a mean loss of 41\% (37-47\%) of the initial biomass after 80 days of incubation. The Ps and lignin contents were strongly affected by incubation; relative lignin content increased at the expense of polysaccharide derivatives. In the original samples, Ps was the principal group of organic compounds in green manure plant materials, with maximum values in blue and white lupine (67\%); after incubation, Ps fractions decreased by 26-51\%, (average 40\%), with the greatest value observed with mucuna and the lowest in white lupine. In soybean plant material the Ps fraction decreased only by 9\%. Greater increases in relative lignin content were observed with Ls (156\%) than with Lg (59\%) derivatives, demonstrating that guaiacyl moieties are easier to biochemically degrade than syringyl moieties. A significant correlation between residue-weight loss and organic groups after 80 days incubation was only found with Ls. Plant materials showing a higher content of syringyl moieties after decomposition might aid ill increasing soil organic matter. Flash pyrolysis was shown to be an adequate technique to follow the process of transformation of plant residues into stabilized soil organic matter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this meta-analysis, I synthesized responses of microbial biomass to N additions in 82 published field studies. I hypothesized that the biomass of fungi, bacteria or the microbial community as a whole would be altered under N additions. I also predicted that changes in biomass would parallel changes in soil CO2 emissions. Microbial biomass declined 15\% on average under N fertilization, but fungi and bacteria were not significantly altered in studies that examined each group separately. Moreover, declines in abundance of microbes and fungi were more evident in studies of longer durations and with higher total amounts of N added. In addition, responses of microbial biomass to N fertilization were significantly correlated with responses of soil CO2 emissions. There were no significant effects of biomes, fertilizer types, ambient N deposition rates or methods of measuring biomass. Altogether, these results suggest that N enrichment could reduce microbial biomass in many ecosystems, with corresponding declines in soil CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {Three commonly employed methods for lignin determination, i.e., the thioglycolic acid (TGA), the acetylbromide (AB), and the acid detergent fiber (ADF) method, were compared using leaves and xylem tissue from five species (Nicotiana tabacum, Populus x canescens, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, and Picea abies). In each case, cell walls were isolated before lignin determination. Each of the three methods estimated a different lignin concentration in a given tissue, except for spruce wood. The "lignin" concentration determined with the AB method was strongly dependent on whether or not the cell walls were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to remove covalently bound aromatic nonligneous components before lignin determination. Lignin concentrations determined in hydrolyzed cell walls of different tissues and species by the AB method showed a good correlation with those obtained by the TGA method and, thus, were convertible. In contrast, gravimetrically estimated ADF lignins did not or only moderately correlate with lignins measured with methods based on the UV absorbance of the solubilized lignin degradation products. Leaves of a given species generally contained higher ADF-lignin concentrations than the corresponding stem tissue. Both ADF and TGA lignin data of beech were used to calibrate near-infrared reflectance spectra (NIRS) for lignin prediction. Both NIRS calibration procedures gave good statistical fits with correlation coefficients close to 1, indicating that TGA and ADF lignin concentrations of beech can be estimated by NIRS with high accuracy. However, the two calibrations were based on different empirical terms, showing that TGA and ADF lignins did not share the same physical basis for calibration. C/N analysis revealed the presence of 3.1 and 1.4\% nitrogen in ADF lignins of beech leaves and wood, respectively. The major fraction of this nitrogen was recovered in amino acids, which corresponded to 14\% and 3\% protein in ADF lignins of leaves and wood, respectively. These results show that ADF lignins contain significant concentrations of lignin-bound proteins, which renders this method unsuitable to determine genuine lignin.},

The natural log transformation of NSAF values from S. cerevisiae cells grown in 14N YPD media and 15N-minimal media had a normal distribution. The t-test analysis demonstrated 221 of 1316 proteins were significantly overexpressed in one or the other growth conditions with a p value <0.05.

abstract = {The characterization of solid wastes is a necessary step before they can be used in anaerobic digestion. The quantities of different compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and fibers) and anaerobic biodegradability (capacity to produce methane) are important information required to characterize waste. The Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) test is one of the most relevant tests for assessing the biodegradability of waste materials. The BMP test is run under anaerobic conditions, using bacteria populations, which makes it very time consuming, i.e., about 30 days. This paper presents alternative methods for determining the anaerobic biodegradability of solid waste. First, we describe the already existing tests for characterizing organic matter. Then we correlate an aerobic test with an anaerobic test in order to estimate anaerobic biodegradability and biogas production. This shortens the analysis time to 5 days. Models using physico-chemical characteristics as input data (total carbohydrate, total nitrogen, fiber, etc.) can predict the amount of methane produced by correlation. Pyrolysis is a very fast analytical test that can be used to characterize solid waste. Lastly, spectroscopy techniques seem to be useful for determining biodegradability, in particular by taking into account the interaction between different molecules in the organic matter.

@article{Hungate2006,
abstract = {Experimentally increasing atmospheric CO2 often stimulates plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) uptake. Biogeochemical theory predicts that these initial responses will immobilize nitrogen (N) in plant biomass and soil organic matter, causing N availability to plants to decline, and reducing the long-term CO2-stimulation of C storage in N limited ecosystems. While many experiments have examined changes in N cycling in response to elevated CO2, empirical tests of this theoretical prediction are scarce. During seven years of postfire recovery in a scrub oak ecosystem, elevated CO2 initially increased plant N accumulation and plant uptake of tracer 15N, peaking after four years of CO2 enrichment. Between years four and seven, these responses to CO2 declined. Elevated CO2 also increased N and tracer 15N accumulation in the O horizon, and reduced 15N recovery in underlying mineral soil. These responses are consistent with progressive N limitation: the initial CO2 stimulation of plant growth immobilized N in plant biomass and in the O horizon, progressively reducing N availability to plants. Litterfall production (one measure of aboveground primary productivity) increased initially in response to elevated CO2, but the CO2 stimulation declined during years five through seven, concurrent with the accumulation of N in the O horizon and the apparent restriction of plant N availability. Yet, at the level of aboveground plant biomass (estimated by allometry), progressive N limitation was less apparent, initially because of increased N acquisition from soil and later because of reduced N concentration in biomass as N availability declined. Over this seven-year period, elevated CO2 caused a redistribution of N within the ecosystem, from mineral soils, to plants, to surface organic matter. In N limited ecosystems, such changes in N cycling are likely to reduce the response of plant production to elevated CO2.},

@article{Kuhn2010a,
abstract = {In this study we provide data which support the interpretation that tissues of higher plants can constitute a significant source of the short chain n-alkanes with an even/odd predominance (EOP) found in soil organic matter. Gas chromatographic analyses of vegetation (C3 trees, C4 grasses) and associated soil samples (woodland and grassland) from a study site in central Queensland, Australia, revealed that (1) woody vegetation (leaves) and grasses (leaves, roots) contain short chain n-alkanes (C14−C20) with pronounced EOP and (2) such homologues dominate the n-alkane assemblages in its woodland and grassland soils. The presence of short chain n-alkanes with an EOP in some of the vegetation suggests that these may represent a significant source of such alkanes in the woodland and grassland soils. Previous studies have shown that combustion induced thermal breakdown of long chain n-alkanes may produce short chain homologues with an EOP. A history of repeated bushfires at the study site may have contributed to the presence of these n-alkanes in its soils. The co-occurrence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons derived from fire (e.g. retene) indicates that heat related generation of short chain n-alkanes indeed may have played an additional part in the formation of the observed soil n-alkane patterns. These two potential origins were further investigated by compound specific carbon and hydrogen isotope analyses of the plant and soil n-alkane assemblages. These data show that the $\delta$13C and $\delta$D signatures of the short chain n-alkanes in the soil resemble those of the plants. Our study therefore provides strong evidence that EOP among short chain n-alkanes can represent a primary (i.e. non-diagenetic) signature, which originates directly from biological sources. In the case of this Queensland soil, the leaves and roots of higher plants are likely to be the principal sources, together with a smaller secondary contribution from the combustion of associated long chain n-alkanes during bushfires.},

abstract = {Although the rates of gross protein depolymerization are central in litter decomposition, they cannot be measured directly by any existing method. Here we report the development of a novel assay to quantify gross protein depolymerization (i.e. gross amino acid production) based on a N-15 isotope pool dilution technique. The assay is based on the concurrent labeling of the pool of 18 proteinogenic amino acids, which are present in a free form in litter, and the measurement of N-15:N-14 ratios in the individual amino acids by GC MS over time. The method proved to be highly linear, precise and sufficiently sensitive. We tested the applicability of the novel method on a litter decomposition experiment, in which we could demonstrate that gross protein depolymerization exceeded gross N mineralization by >8 fold indicating that only a small fraction of amino acids released by extracellular enzymes was actually mineralized to ammonium. Moreover, the results provide evidence that protein depolymerization was limited by protein availability or accessibility, not by the size of protease pool. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Microscale sealed vessel pyrolysis (MSSVpy) with online gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used with several other established and complementary analytical methods to robustly characterize the structure of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) and to practically assess the analytical value of MSSVpy. The NOM used in the study was from North Pine (NP) reservoir, which is one of the major source waters supplying Brisbane, the capital city of the Australian state of Queensland. The reservoir has moderate dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 5mgL(-1)) levels and is impacted by algae which periodically occur in bloom proportions. The hydrophobic (HPO; 65\% initial DOC) and transphilic (TPI; 12\%) fractions showed H/C values >1, low UV(abs) and low aryl-C measured by NMR which are all indicative of low aromaticity. MSSVpy produced distinctly higher product concentrations than traditional flash pyrolysis and the molecular profile of the HPO and TPI fractions revealed by MSSVpy was correlated with the other analytical data to help establish their structural relevance. Prolific distributions of alkyl substituted aromatic (e.g., benzenes, naphthalenes) and hydroaromatic (e.g., tetralins) products detected in the HPO fraction were attributed to the aromatisation of terpanes and other aliphatic compounds from algal, and possibly also plant sources. Alkyl phenols also detected in HPO in high abundance, are probably from algal biopolymers, but may also reflect a contribution from non-methoxylated lignin units of catchment grasses. There was no analytical evidence of the dihydroxy or methoxy aromatic structures typical of wood lignin or tannin. N-organic pyrolysates (e.g., alkyl pyrroles, pyridines, indoles) of diagenetically altered proteins were concentrated in the TPI fraction. The quantitative importance of the N-organic moiety of the TPI fraction was corroborated by a low C/N ratio and distinctive amide and amine signals detected by (13)C NMR and FTIR. This integrated study demonstrates that the qualitative speciation provided by MSSVpy can make a significant contribution to the structural characterisation and source recognition of aquatic NOM.},

To date, however, reports are scarce and sometimes contradictory, and suffer from methodological problems. Only in a single cephalopod species has the chitin been identified as beta-chitin. We present data on chitin occurrence in 22 species of shell-bearing Mollusca (Conchifera) and Polyplacophora, including the first evidence for scaphopods, based on pyrolysis gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Pyrolysis GC-MS detected chitin in every tested member of the Conchifera. IR spectroscopy before and after chitinase treatment revealed at least three distinct patterns of peak changes. The contents of the insoluble shell organics included not only chitin and proteins, but also insoluble polysaccharides, e.g., glucan. We conclude that chitin was present in the last common ancestor of the Conchifera and that its abundance in the shell matrix depends on the differentiation of the shell.},

abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

abstract = {With anthropogenic nutrient inputs to ecosystems increasing globally, there are long-standing, fundamental questions about the role of nutrients in the decomposition of organic matter. We tested the effects of exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus inputs on litter decomposition across a broad suite of litter and soil types. In one experiment, C mineralization was compared across a wide array of plants individually added to a single soil, while in the second, C mineralization from a single substrate was compared across 50 soils. Counter to basic stoichiometric decomposition theory, low N availability can increase litter decomposition as microbes use labile substrates to acquire N from recalcitrant organic matter. This "microbial nitrogen mining" is consistently suppressed by high soil N supply or substrate N concentrations. There is no evidence for phosphorus mining as P fertilization increases short- and long-term mineralization. These results suggest that basic stoichiometric decomposition theory needs to be revised and ecosystem models restructured accordingly in order to predict ecosystem carbon storage responses to anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability.},

abstract = {In soils, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is probably the most bioavailable fraction of soil organic matter, since all microbial uptake mechanisms require a water environment. Bioavailability describes the potential of microorganisms to interact with DOM. It is a prerequisite for biodegradation and can be restricted, if DOM is present in small pores or within soil aggregates and therefore not accessible for microorganisms. DOM biodegradation is defined as the utilisation of organic compounds by soil microorganisms quantified by the disappearance of DOM or O2 or by the evolution of CO2. The controlling factors for DOM biodegradability can be divided into three groups, namely, intrinsic DOM quality parameters, soil and solution parameters and external factors. DOM characteristics that generally enhance its biodegradability are high contents of carbohydrates, organic acids and proteins for which the hydrophilic neutral fraction seems to be a good estimate. In contrast, aromatic and hydrophobic structures that can also be assessed by UV absorbance decrease DOM biodegradability, either due to their recalcitrance or due to inhibiting effects on enzyme activity. Effects of solution parameters such as Al, Fe, Ca and heavy metal concentrations on DOM biodegradability have been documented in various studies, however with different, sometimes conflicting results. Inhibitory effects of metals are generally attributed to toxicity of the organic complexes or the free metal ions. In contrast, the enhanced degradability observed in the presence of metal ions may be due to flocculation, as larger structures will provide better attachment for microbial colonies. As degradation is dependent on microbial activity, the composition and density of the microbial population used in the degradation studies also influence biodegradation. Site-specific factors, such as vegetation, land use and seasonality of meteorological parameters control DOM composition and soil and soil solution properties and therefore also affect its biodegradability. The major obstacle for a better understanding of the controls of DOM biodegradability is the lack of a standardised methodology or at least systematic comparisons between the large number of methods used to assess DOM biodegradability.},

abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) dating of total soil organic matter (SOM) often yields results inconsistent with the stratigraphic sequence. The onerous chemical extractions for SOM fractions do not always produce satisfactory 14C dates. In an effort to develop an alternative method, the pyrolysis-combustion technique was investigated to partition SOM into pyrolysis volatile (Py-V) and pyrolysis residue (Py-R) fractions. The Py-V fractions obtained from a thick glacigenic loess succession in Illinois yielded 14C dates much younger but more reasonable than the counterpart Py-R fractions for the soil residence time. Carbon isotopic composition 13C) was heavier in the Py-V fractions, suggesting a greater abundance of carbohydrate- and protein-related constituents, and 13C was lighter in the Py-R fractions, suggesting more ligninand lipid-related constituents. The combination of 14C dates and 13C values indicates that the Py-V fractions are less biodegradation resistant and the Py-R fractions are more biodegradation resistant. The pyrolysis-combustion method provides a less cumbersome approach for 14C dating of SOM fractions. With further study, this method may become a useful tool for analyzing unlithified terrestrial sediments when macrofossils are absent.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. A better understanding of the global relationship between environmental characteristics, ecosystems and SOM chemistry is vital in order to assess its specific influence on carbon cycles. This study compared the composition of extracted SOM in 18 topsoil samples taken under tundra, taiga, steppe, temperate forest and tropical forest using pyrolysis-GC/MS. Results indicate that SOM from cold climates (tundra, taiga) still resembles the composition of litter, evidenced by high quantities of levosugars and long alkanes relative to N-compounds and a clear odd-over-even dominance of the longer alkanes. Under temperate conditions, increased microbial degradation generally results in a more altered SOM chemistry. SOM formed under temperate coniferous forests shows an accumulation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties, probably induced by substrate limitations. Tropical SOM was characterized by an SOM composition rich in N-compounds and low in lignins, without any accumulation of recalcitrant fractions (i.e. aliphatic and aromatic compounds). Lignin composition moreover varies according to vegetation type. Results were validated against 13 new samples. The humic signature of topsoil organic matter formed under different biomes indicates a dominating effect of (i) SOM input composition related to vegetation, and (ii) SOM breakdown reflecting both climate and input quality. No evidence was found for a chemically stabilized SOM fraction under favorable decomposition conditions (temperate or warm climate with broadleaved vegetation). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A collection of tannins extracted from various plant species was subjected to thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The products obtained included 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes, derived from A rings of condensed tannins (CTs), and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, and derivatives as major products from the B ring. 1,2,4-Tri- and two tetramethoxybenzenes were also detected in most analyses. Correlation analyses revealed that they were derived from the B ring, with 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene being derived from a procyanidin (PC) B ring and 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxybenzene from a prodelphinidin (PD) ring. Tannins from species that contained both CT and hydrolyzable tannin (HT) produced mainly permethylated gallic acid moieties upon THM, and the products derived from CTs were less abundant. Most likely, the ester-bound HTs are more easily transmethylated than the cleavage and methylation of the C-C and C-O linked CTs. Statistical analyses of the THM products and 13C NMR data of the tannins showed good correlations between the B ring hydroxylation and the di- and trimethoxybenzenes observed. Using the ratio of the methyl esters of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid only provided good correlations of the percent PC as well. Furthermore, the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes may serve as good markers of tannins in plant, soil, sediment or other samples as analyzed by THM.},

abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Nierop2004a,
abstract = {Each plant species has a unique chemical composition, and also within a given plant the various tissues differ from one another in their chemistry. These different compositions can be traced back after decay of the plant parts when they are transformed into soil organic matter (SOM). As a result, the composition of SOM reflects not only the plant origin, but also the various tissues, and the composition consequently provides an estimate of the contribution of above-ground vs. below-ground litter. From the latter distribution the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Application of thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) releases all typical cutin- and suberin-derived aliphatic monomers (mono-, di- and trihydroxyalkanoic acids, alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) as their methyl esters and/or ethers in a rapid manner. Using the distribution of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids that are present in pine needle cutin (C(12) and C(14)) and not in root suberin, and those that are present in roots but not in needles (C(20) and C(22)), the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground plant litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Similarly, the (9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid+9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid)/(C(20) + C(22) alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) ratio reflects the degree of bioturbation. Three mineral soil profiles under Corsican pine with an A horizon that exhibited extensive bioturbation phenomena, and underlying C horizons with hardly any or no bioturbation, were investigated in order to examine the applicability of such an approach. It appeared that the A horizons contained all four mentioned omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids, while the C horizons contained virtually only the C(20) and C(22) members. The results not only suggest that bioturbation occurs in the A horizons, but also that possible illuviation or other transport mechanisms of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids seem hardly ever or never to occur, which is a prerequisite for applying this biomarker approach in assessing degrees of bioturbation.},

abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

abstract = {We present the analysis of the stable carbon isotope compositions of 14 individual N-pivaloyl-isopropyl (NPP) amino acid esters by gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). The mean reproducibility of derivatization procedure and GC-C-IRMS analysis was 0.45 per thousand (range, 0.12-0.68), whereas the mean analytical error was 0.26 per thousand delta(13)C (range, 0.13-0.42). Furthermore, the delta(13)C values of N-pivaloyl-isopropyl and N-acetyl-n-propyl (NAP) amino acid esters were compared. Due to a reproducible isotopic fractionation introduced by the derivatization process an empirical correction factor for each individual amino acid was derived separately for both derivatives (NPP, -1.13 to -2.52 (lysine, +2.09) per thousand delta(13)C; NAP, -2.36 to -3.97 (lysine, +1.91) per thousand delta(13)C), and the original delta(13)C value of the underivatized amino acid was calculated. Further, we performed an animal study where rats (n = 5) ingested a mixed meal containing uniformly (13)C-labeled casein (indispensable amino acids 1.3 to 1.7 at.\%). One hour after the meal delta(13)C values of protein-bound amino acids from small intestinal mucosa and liver and of free amino acids from mucosa and plasma were determined. Significant (13)C enrichments of indispensable amino acids of the free pools of mucosa and plasma (range, 0.0518 to 0.1700 at.\% excess) and in mucosa and liver proteins (range, 0.0021 and 0.0161 at.\% excess) were observed. The feasibility of various derivatives for the measurement of carbon isotopic composition is discussed.},

Root to shoot biomass production ratios (R/S) in mixtures were lower than expected from monoculture performance of the species present in the mixtures, showing that interactions among species led to reduced biomass partitioning to belowground organs. This change in partitioning to belowground organs was not confined to mixtures with legumes, but also measured in mixtures without legumes, and correlated with aboveground overyielding in mixtures.

@article{Hobbie2006,
abstract = {When soil nitrogen is in short supply, most terrestrial plants form symbioses with fungi (mycorrhizae): hyphae take up soil nitrogen, transport it into plant roots, and receive plant sugars in return. In ecosystems, the transfers within the pathway fractionate nitrogen isotopes so that the natural abundance of 15N in fungi differs from that in their host plants by as much as 12\% per hundred. Here we present a new method to quantify carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the symbiosis based on the fractionation against 15N during transfer of nitrogen from fungi to plant roots. We tested this method, which is based on the mass balance of 15N, with data from arctic Alaska where the nitrogen cycle is well studied. Mycorrhizal fungi provided 61-86\% of the nitrogen in plants; plants provided 8-17\% of their photosynthetic carbon to the fungi for growth and respiration. This method of analysis avoids the disturbance of the soil-microbe-root relationship caused by collecting samples, mixing the soil, or changing substrate concentrations. This analytical technique also can be applied to other nitrogen-limited ecosystems, such as many temperate and boreal forests, to quantify the importance for terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling of nutrient transfers mediated by mycorrhizae at the plant-soil interface.},

abstract = {Intense efforts are currently devoted to disentangling the relationships between plant carbon (C) allocation patterns and soil nitrogen (N) availability because of their consequences for growth and more generally for C sequestration. In cold ecosystems, only a few studies have addressed whole-plant C and/or N allocation along natural elevational or topographical gradients. (12)C/(13)C and (14)N/(15)N isotope techniques have been used to elucidate C and N partitioning in two alpine graminoids characterized by contrasted nutrient economies: a slow-growing species, Kobresia myosuroides (KM), and a fast-growing species, Carex foetida (CF), located in early and late snowmelt habitats, respectively, within the alpine tundra (French Alps). CF allocated higher labelling-related (13)C content belowground and produced more root biomass. Furthermore, assimilates transferred to the roots were preferentially used for growth rather than respiration and tended to favour N reduction in this compartment. Accordingly, this species had higher (15)N uptake efficiency than KM and a higher translocation of reduced (15)N to aboveground organs. These results suggest that at the whole-plant level, there is a compromise between N acquisition/reduction and C allocation patterns for optimized growth.},

abstract = {The more individuals hypothesis (MIH) postulates that productivity increases species richness by increasing mean equilibrium population size, thereby reducing the probability of local extinction. We tested the MIH for invertebrates colonizing microcosms that simulated tree holes by manipulating productivity through additions of leaf or animal detritus and subsequently determining the relationships among richness, total abundance, abundance per species, and measures of productivity. We quantified productivity as the rate of microorganism protein synthesis, microorganism metabolic rate, nutrient ion concentration, and type and amount of detritus. Microcosms with animal detritus attracted more species, more individuals per species, and more total individuals than did microcosms with similar amounts of leaf detritus. Relationships between richness or abundance and productivity varied with date. Richness in June increased as a linear function of productivity, whereas the power function predicted by the MIH fit best in July. Abundance in June and July was best described by a power function of productivity, but the linear function predicted by the MIH fit best in September. Abundance per species was best described by a power function of productivity in June and July. Path analysis showed that the indirect effect of productivity through abundance on richness that is predicted by MIH was important in all months, and that direct links between productivity and richness were unnecessary. Our results support many of the predictions of the MIH, but they also suggest that the effects of abundance on richness may be more complex than expected.},

abstract = {BIOLOG GN plates are increasingly used to characterize microbial communities by determining the ability of the communities to oxidize various carbon sources. Studies were done to determine whether the BIOLOG GN plate assay accurately reflects the catabolic potential of the inoculum used. To gain insight into which populations of microbial communities contribute to the BIOLOG patterns, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) were used to assess the diversity of ribotypes in the inocula and individual wells of BIOLOG plates following incubation. These studies were done with microbial communities from the rhizosphere of potatoes and an activated sludge reactor fed with glucose and peptone. TGGE analyses of BIOLOG wells inoculated with cell suspensions from the potato rhizosphere revealed that, compared with the inoculum, there was a decrease in the number of 16S rRNA gene fragments obtained from various wells, as well as a concomitant loss of populations that had been numerically dominant in the inoculum. The dominant fragments in TGGE gels could be assigned to the gamma subclass of the class Proteobacteria, suggesting that fast-growing bacteria adapted to high substrate concentrations were numerically dominant in the wells and may have been primarily responsible for the patterns of substrate use that were observed. Similarly, the community structure changed in wells inoculated with cells from activated sludge; one or more populations were enriched, but all dominant populations of the inoculum could be detected in at least one well. This study showed that carbon source utilization profiles obtained with BIOLOG GN plates do not necessarily reflect the functional potential of the numerically dominant members of the microbial community used as the inoculum.},

abstract = {Leaf litter and other organic resources returned to the soil are important regulators of ecological processes in forest ecosystems, and their ecological impacts may be strongly influenced both by their quality and by interactions between coexisting resource types. To date, most studies on effects of resource identity and mixing have only involved leaf litter, despite the fact that other resource types constitute a major input to the soil. We investigated how quality and heterogeneity of organic substrates found in boreal forests affects the activity and community structure of soil microbes, and plant growth. Six organic substrates (wood, charcoal, berries, sporocarps, vertebrate faeces and leaf litter) were added singly or in mixtures of two, three and six resource types to pots containing forest soil (with or without tree seedlings of Betula pendula Roth). The largest positive effects of single substrates on microbial basal respiration (BR), substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were found for nutrient-rich substrates (faeces and sporocarps) or substrates with high sugar-content (berries). Mixing of substrates had no effect on BR or SIR, but decreased qCO(2) or altered the microbial community structure for specific combinations of substrates. In contrast to the niche complementarity hypothesis, microbial catabolic diversity was not stimulated by greater diversity of resources. Seedling growth responses to single substrates were neutral or negative; the inhibition of growth probably resulted largely from microbial competition for nutrients. Substrate mixing enhanced seedling nutrient-uptake and growth for all mixtures containing sporocarps and leaf litter. Overall, plants responded more strongly to resource heterogeneity than microbes, and synergistic effects only occurred when nutrient-rich substrates were present within the substrate mixtures. In particular, our results demonstrate a role for complex and non-additive interactions among previously overlooked resource types returned to the soil in influencing ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and plant productivity.},

abstract = {A comprehensive phylogenetic classification of the kingdom Fungi is proposed, with reference to recent molecular phylogenetic analyses, and with input from diverse members of the fungal taxonomic community. The classification includes 195 taxa, down to the level of order, of which 16 are described or validated here: Dikarya subkingdom nov.; Chytridiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota phyla nov.; Monoblepharidomycetes, Neocallimastigomycetes class. nov.; Eurotiomycetidae, Lecanoromycetidae, Mycocaliciomycetidae subclass. nov.; Acarosporales, Corticiales, Baeomycetales, Candelariales, Gloeophyllales, Melanosporales, Trechisporales, Umbilicariales ords. nov. The clade containing Ascomycota and Basidiomycota is classified as subkingdom Dikarya, reflecting the putative synapomorphy of dikaryotic hyphae. The most dramatic shifts in the classification relative to previous works concern the groups that have traditionally been included in the Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota. The Chytridiomycota is retained in a restricted sense, with Blastocladiomycota and Neocallimastigomycota representing segregate phyla of flagellated Fungi. Taxa traditionally placed in Zygomycota are distributed among Glomeromycota and several subphyla incertae sedis, including Mucoromycotina, Entomophthoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, and Zoopagomycotina. Microsporidia are included in the Fungi, but no further subdivision of the group is proposed. Several genera of 'basal' Fungi of uncertain position are not placed in any higher taxa, including Basidiobolus, Caulochytrium, Olpidium, and Rozella.},

Recent advances in secondary ion mass spectrometry have improved sensitivity and spatial resolution, so that these methods have the potential to bridge between high-resolution structures obtained by X-ray crystallography and cyro-electron microscopy and ultrastructure visualized by conventional light microscopy. Following background information on the method and instrumentation, we address the key issue of sample preparation. Because mass spectrometry is performed in high vacuum, it is essential to preserve the lateral organization of the sample while removing bulk water, and this has been a major barrier for applications to biological systems. Recent applications of imaging mass spectrometry to cell biology, microbial communities, and biosynthetic pathways are summarized briefly, and studies of biological membrane organization are described in greater depth.},

abstract = {Glacier forefields are an ideal playground to investigate the role of development stages of soils on the formation of plant-microbe interactions as within the last decades, many alpine glaciers retreated, whereby releasing and exposing parent material for soil development. Especially the status of macronutrients like nitrogen differs between soils of different development stages in these environments and may influence plant growth significantly. Thus, in this study, we reconstructed major parts of the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil/root system of Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) HEYWOOD: as well as the corresponding bulk soil by quantifying functional genes of nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrogen mineralisation (chiA, aprA), nitrification (amoA AOB, amoA AOA) and denitrification (nirS, nirK and nosZ) in a 10-year and a 120-year ice-free soil of the Damma glacier forefield. We linked the results to the ammonium and nitrate concentrations of the soils as well as to the nitrogen and carbon status of the plants. The experiment was performed in a greenhouse simulating the climatic conditions of the glacier forefield. Samples were taken after 7 and 13 weeks of plant growth. Highest nifH gene abundance in connection with lowest nitrogen content of L. alpina was observed in the 10-year soil after 7 weeks of plant growth, demonstrating the important role of associative nitrogen fixation for plant development in this soil. In contrast, in the 120-year soil copy numbers of genes involved in denitrification, mainly nosZ were increased after 13 weeks of plant growth, indicating an overall increased microbial activity status as well as higher concentrations of nitrate in this soil.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) were determined for alanine, proline, phenylalanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, aspartate (aspartic acid and asparagine), glutamate (glutamic acid and glutamine), lysine, serine, glycine, and threonine from metabolically diverse microorganisms. The microorganisms examined included fermenting bacteria, organotrophic, chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, methylotrophic, methanogenic, acetogenic, acetotrophic, and naturally occurring cryptoendolithic communities from the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Here we demonstrated that reactions involved in amino acid biosynthesis can be used to distinguish amino acids formed by life from those formed by nonbiological processes. The unique patterns of delta(13)C imprinted by life on amino acids produced a biological bias. We also showed that, by applying discriminant function analysis to the delta(13)C value of a pool of amino acids formed by biological activity, it was possible to identify key aspects of intermediary carbon metabolism in the microbial world. In fact, microorganisms examined in this study could be placed within one of three metabolic groups: (1) heterotrophs that grow by oxidizing compounds containing three or more carbon-to-carbon bonds (fermenters and organotrophs), (2) autotrophs that grow by taking up carbon dioxide (chemolitotrophs and phototrophs), and (3) acetoclastic microbes that grow by assimilation of formaldehyde or acetate (methylotrophs, methanogens, acetogens, and acetotrophs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that cryptoendolithic communities from Antarctica grouped most closely with the autotrophs, which indicates that the dominant metabolic pathways in these communities are likely those utilized for CO(2 )fixation. We propose that this technique can be used to determine the dominant metabolic types in a community and reveal the overall flow of carbon in a complex ecosystem.},

abstract = {During microbial breakdown of leaf litter a fraction of the C lost by the litter is not released to the atmosphere as CO(2) but remains in the soil as microbial byproducts. The amount of this fraction and the factors influencing its size are not yet clearly known. We performed a laboratory experiment to quantify the flow of C from decaying litter into the soil, by means of stable C isotopes, and tested its dependence on litter chemical properties. Three sets of (13)C-depleted leaf litter (Liquidambar styraciflua L., Cercis canadensis L. and Pinus taeda L.) were incubated in the laboratory in jars containing (13)C-enriched soil (i.e. formed C4 vegetation). Four jars containing soil only were used as a control. Litter chemical properties were measured using thermogravimetry (Tg) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-combustion interface-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS-C-IRMS). The respiration rates and the delta(13)C of the respired CO(2) were measured at regular intervals. After 8 months of incubation, soils incubated with both L. styraciflua and C. canadensis showed a significant change in delta(13)C (delta(13)C(final) = -20.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand and -19.5 +/- 0.5 per thousand, respectively) with respect to the initial value (delta(13)C(initial) = -17.7 +/- 0.3 per thousand); the same did not hold for soil incubated with P. taeda (delta(13)C(final:)-18.1 +/- 0.5 per thousand). The percentages of litter-derived C in soil over the total C loss were not statistically different from one litter species to another. This suggests that there is no dependence of the percentage of C input into the soil (over the total C loss) on litter quality and that the fractional loss of leaf litter C is dependent only on the microbial assimilation efficiency. The percentage of litter-derived C in soil was estimated to be 13 +/- 3\% of total C loss.},

The experimental design included (i) preparation of the (15)N-labeled organic matter (city refuse compost, 640 g kg(-1) wheat straw and K(15)NO(3) composted for 80 days), (ii) a further 80 day incubation of a mixture of the labeled compost with a mineral soil (32 g kg(-1)), (iii) measurement of stable isotope ratios, and (iv) isolation and structural comparison by (13)C and (15)N cross-polarization, magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of different organic fractions, i.e., soluble, colloidal (humic and fulvic type), and particulate (free organic matter and humin), from both the compost and the compost-treated soil. The results showed that the amide forms dominated in all of the newly formed N compounds, but an increased amount of alkali insoluble organic fractions was observed after incubation of the soil. The analysis of the insoluble, particulate fractions shows that nonextractable amides constitute the major pool of newly formed N compounds. The particulate soil fraction isolated by flotation in CHBr(3)-MeOH contained 16.8\% of the total soil N and 26\% of the (15)N. The (13)C NMR spectra showed that the fulvic acid-like fraction (7.6\% of the soil N, 8.8\% of (15)N) consisted almost completely of a C=O-containing carbohydrate material, whereas the humic acid-like fraction (20.3\% of the total soil N, 8.6\% of (15)N) resembled an oxidized lignoproteic fraction containing the most significant aromatic domain. The water soluble fraction was, in both soil and compost, the one with the highest isotopic abundance of (15)N (96\%), but the (15)N NMR spectrum revealed minor amounts of soluble mineral N in this fraction and the remainder consisting of amide compounds.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal has a powerful influence on population dynamics, genetic structuring, evolutionary rates, and community ecology. Yet, patterns of seed dispersal are difficult to measure due to methodological shortcomings in tracking dispersed seeds from sources of interest. Here we introduce a new method to track seed dispersal: stable isotope enrichment. It consists of leaf-feeding plants with sprays of 15N-urea during the flowering stage such that seeds developed after applications are isotopically enriched. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with Solanum americanum and two field experiments with wild Capsicum annuum in southern Arizona, USA, to field-validate the method. First, we show that plants sprayed with 15N-urea reliably produce isotopically enriched progeny, and that delta 15N (i.e., the isotopic ratio) of seeds and seedlings is a linear function of the 15N-urea concentration sprayed on mothers. We demonstrate that three urea dosages can be used to distinctly enrich plants and unambiguously differentiate their offspring after seeds are dispersed by birds. We found that, with high urea dosages, the resulting delta 15N values in seedlings are 10(3) - 10(4) times higher than the delta 15N values of normal plants. This feature allows tracking not only where seeds arrive, but in locations where seeds germinate and recruit, because delta 15N enrichment is detectable in seedlings that have increased in mass by at least two orders of magnitude before fading to normal delta 15N values. Last, we tested a mixing model to analyze seed samples in bulk. We used the delta 15N values of batches (i.e., combined seedlings or seeds captured in seed traps) to estimate the number of enriched seeds coming from isotopically enriched plants in the field. We confirm that isotope enrichment, combined with batch-sampling, is a cheap, reliable, and user-friendly method for bulk-processing seeds and is thus excellent for the detection of rare dispersal events. This method could further the study of dispersal biology, including the elusive, but critically important, estimation of long-distance seed dispersal.},

abstract = {Agriculture is a source for three primary greenhouse gases (GHGs): CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O. It can also be a sink for CO(2) through C sequestration into biomass products and soil organic matter. We summarized the literature on GHG emissions and C sequestration, providing a perspective on how agriculture can reduce its GHG burden and how it can help to mitigate GHG emissions through conservation measures. Impacts of agricultural practices and systems on GHG emission are reviewed and potential trade-offs among potential mitigation options are discussed. Conservation practices that help prevent soil erosion, may also sequester soil C and enhance CH(4) consumption. Managing N to match crop needs can reduce N(2)O emission and avoid adverse impacts on water quality. Manipulating animal diet and manure management can reduce CH(4) and N(2)O emission from animal agriculture. All segments of agriculture have management options that can reduce agriculture's environmental footprint.},

The modified Folch method rendered the greatest total amount of PLFAs and the highest yields of individual PLFA biomarkers; the effect was most apparent in the vermicompost samples. MAE rendered similar extraction yields as the modified Bligh and Dyer method (the most commonly used extraction method), although MAE is much simpler and faster. The highest conversion yields of PLFAs into fatty acid methyl esters were achieved with TMSH as the derivatization agent. The modified Folch method together with derivatization with TMSH was the least complex and time consuming method of determining microbial community structure in solid environmental samples.},

All three CAM species showed a typical feature of CAM with nocturnal malate increase.

In the two Kalancho\"{e} species, a small nocturnal citrate increase was found and K. daigremontiana showed a small nocturnal isocitrate increase. Glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), fructose 6-phosphate (F-6-P) and glucose 1-phosphate (G-1-P) levels in the three CAM species rose rapidly during the first part of the dark period and decreased during the latter part of the dark period. The levels of the metabolites also decreased during the first 3 h of the light period, then, remained little changed through the rest of the light period. Absolute levels of G-6-P, F-6-P and G-1-P were higher in pineapple than in the two Kalancho\"{e} species. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P(2)) levels in the three CAM species increased during the dark period, then dramatically decreased during the first 3 h of the light period and remained unchanged through the rest of the light period. The extent of nocturnal F-1,6-P(2) increase was far greater in the two Kalancho\"{e} species than in pineapple. Absolute levels of F-1,6-P(2) were higher in the two Kalancho\"{e} species than in pineapple, especially during dark period.

abstract = {We present the analysis of the stable carbon isotope compositions of 14 individual N-pivaloyl-isopropyl (NPP) amino acid esters by gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). The mean reproducibility of derivatization procedure and GC-C-IRMS analysis was 0.45 per thousand (range, 0.12-0.68), whereas the mean analytical error was 0.26 per thousand delta(13)C (range, 0.13-0.42). Furthermore, the delta(13)C values of N-pivaloyl-isopropyl and N-acetyl-n-propyl (NAP) amino acid esters were compared. Due to a reproducible isotopic fractionation introduced by the derivatization process an empirical correction factor for each individual amino acid was derived separately for both derivatives (NPP, -1.13 to -2.52 (lysine, +2.09) per thousand delta(13)C; NAP, -2.36 to -3.97 (lysine, +1.91) per thousand delta(13)C), and the original delta(13)C value of the underivatized amino acid was calculated. Further, we performed an animal study where rats (n = 5) ingested a mixed meal containing uniformly (13)C-labeled casein (indispensable amino acids 1.3 to 1.7 at.\%). One hour after the meal delta(13)C values of protein-bound amino acids from small intestinal mucosa and liver and of free amino acids from mucosa and plasma were determined. Significant (13)C enrichments of indispensable amino acids of the free pools of mucosa and plasma (range, 0.0518 to 0.1700 at.\% excess) and in mucosa and liver proteins (range, 0.0021 and 0.0161 at.\% excess) were observed. The feasibility of various derivatives for the measurement of carbon isotopic composition is discussed.},

abstract = {Geological and palaeomagnetic studies indicate that ice sheets may have reached the Equator at the end of the Proterozoic eon, 800 to 550 million years ago, leading to the suggestion of a fully ice-covered 'snowball Earth'. Climate model simulations indicate that such a snowball state for the Earth depends on anomalously low atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, in addition to the Sun being 6 per cent fainter than it is today. However, the mechanisms producing such low carbon dioxide concentrations remain controversial. Here we assess the effect of the palaeogeographic changes preceding the Sturtian glacial period, 750 million years ago, on the long-term evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels using the coupled climate-geochemical model GEOCLIM. In our simulation, the continental break-up of Rodinia leads to an increase in runoff and hence consumption of carbon dioxide through continental weathering that decreases atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations by 1,320 p.p.m. This indicates that tectonic changes could have triggered a progressive transition from a 'greenhouse' to an 'icehouse' climate during the Neoproterozoic era. When we combine these results with the concomitant weathering effect of the voluminous basaltic traps erupted throughout the break-up of Rodinia, our simulation results in a snowball glaciation.},

abstract = {In tropical rain forests, rates of forest turnover and tree species' life-history differences are shaped by the life expectancy of trees and the time taken by seedlings to reach the canopy. These measures are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However, the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment, age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent). We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size from growth rings and 14C from some of the same species at the same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new results for life histories of tropical trees.},

abstract = {The Hadley Centre coupled climate-carbon cycle model (HadCM3LC) predicts loss of the Amazon rainforest in response to future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the atmospheric component of HadCM3LC is used to assess the role of simulated changes in mid-twenty-first century sea surface temperature (SST) in Amazon Basin climate change. When the full HadCM3LC SST anomalies (SSTAs) are used, the atmosphere model reproduces the Amazon Basin climate change exhibited by HadCM3LC, including much of the reduction in Amazon Basin rainfall. This rainfall change is shown to be the combined effect of SSTAs in both the tropical Atlantic and the Pacific, with roughly equal contributions from each basin. The greatest rainfall reduction occurs from May to October, outside of the mature South American monsoon (SAM) season. This dry season response is the combined effect of a more rapid warming of the tropical North Atlantic relative to the south, and warm SSTAs in the tropical east Pacific. Conversely, a weak enhancement of mature SAM season rainfall in response to Atlantic SST change is suppressed by the atmospheric response to Pacific SST. This net wet season response is sufficient to prevent dry season soil moisture deficits from being recharged through the SAM season, leading to a perennial soil moisture reduction and an associated 30\% reduction in annual Amazon Basin net primary productivity (NPP). A further 23\% NPP reduction occurs in response to a 3.5 degrees C warmer air temperature associated with a global mean SST warming.},

abstract = {Intense efforts are currently devoted to disentangling the relationships between plant carbon (C) allocation patterns and soil nitrogen (N) availability because of their consequences for growth and more generally for C sequestration. In cold ecosystems, only a few studies have addressed whole-plant C and/or N allocation along natural elevational or topographical gradients. (12)C/(13)C and (14)N/(15)N isotope techniques have been used to elucidate C and N partitioning in two alpine graminoids characterized by contrasted nutrient economies: a slow-growing species, Kobresia myosuroides (KM), and a fast-growing species, Carex foetida (CF), located in early and late snowmelt habitats, respectively, within the alpine tundra (French Alps). CF allocated higher labelling-related (13)C content belowground and produced more root biomass. Furthermore, assimilates transferred to the roots were preferentially used for growth rather than respiration and tended to favour N reduction in this compartment. Accordingly, this species had higher (15)N uptake efficiency than KM and a higher translocation of reduced (15)N to aboveground organs. These results suggest that at the whole-plant level, there is a compromise between N acquisition/reduction and C allocation patterns for optimized growth.},

abstract = {Conifers are the most important group of gymnosperms, which include tree species of great ecological and economic importance that dominate large ecosystems and play an essential role in global carbon fixation. Nitrogen (N) economy has a special importance in these woody plants that are able to cope with seasonal periods of growth and development over a large number of years. As N availability in the forest soil is extremely low, efficient mechanisms are required for the assimilation, storage, mobilization, and recycling of inorganic and organic forms of N. The cyclic interconversion of arginine and the amides glutamine and asparagine plays a central role in the N metabolism of conifers and the regulation of these pathways is of major relevance to the N economy of the plant. In this paper, details of recent progress in our understanding of the metabolism of arginine and the other major amino acids glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine in pine, a conifer model tree, are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The measurement of delta15N values of inorganic nitrogen species is an important analytical tool to trace nitrogen species in order to understand nitrogen cycling in aquatic systems. Nitrogen isotope analysis of freshwater ammonium has, however, been hindered by the lack of a simple and reliable technique to measure delta15N values at natural abundance levels. We present a simple and rapid method to concentrate ammonium from freshwater samples for on-line N-isotope ratio determination. Ammonium is collected by adsorption on N-free cation exchange resins. The dried N-loaded exchange resin is then directly combusted to produce N2 gas for subsequent delta15N analysis. The method was evaluated with simulated freshwater solutions containing varying amounts of standard NH4+-N (delta15N = 2.1 per thousand) and potentially interfering inorganic and organic compounds. In general, the cation exchange resin method gives accurate and reproducible delta15N values (sigma1 < 0.3 per thousand; n = 10). Because of adsorption interference, high concentrations of cations in solution may cause ammonium loss but do not result in measurable isotope fractionation. Replicate extractions of the ammonium standard added to water collected from four Swiss lakes demonstrate the good performance of this method when applied to low ionic strength natural water samples with modest concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen.},

abstract = {We compared the microbial community composition in soils from the Brazilian Amazon with two contrasting histories; anthrosols and their adjacent non-anthrosol soils of the same mineralogy. The anthrosols, also known as the Amazonian Dark Earths or terra preta, were managed by the indigenous pre-Colombian Indians between 500 and 8,700 years before present and are characterized by unusually high cation exchange capacity, phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) contents, and soil carbon pools that contain a high proportion of incompletely combusted biomass as biochar or black carbon (BC). We sampled paired anthrosol and unmodified soils from four locations in the Manaus, Brazil, region that differed in their current land use and soil type. Community DNA was extracted from sampled soils and characterized by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. DNA bands of interest from Bacteria and Archaea DGGE gels were cloned and sequenced. In cluster analyses of the DNA fingerprints, microbial communities from the anthrosols grouped together regardless of current land use or soil type and were distinct from those in their respective, paired adjacent soils. For the Archaea, the anthrosol communities diverged from the adjacent soils by over 90\%. A greater overall richness was observed for Bacteria sequences as compared with those of the Archaea. Most of the sequences obtained were novel and matched those in databases at less than 98\% similarity. Several sequences obtained only from the anthrosols grouped at 93\% similarity with the Verrucomicrobia, a genus commonly found in rice paddies in the tropics. Sequences closely related to Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria sp. were recovered only from adjacent soil samples. Sequences related to Pseudomonas, Acidobacteria, and Flexibacter sp. were recovered from both anthrosols and adjacent soils. The strong similarities among the microbial communities present in the anthrosols for both the Bacteria and Archaea suggests that the microbial community composition in these soils is controlled more strongly by their historical soil management than by soil type or current land use. The anthrosols had consistently higher concentrations of incompletely combusted organic black carbon material (BC), higher soil pH, and higher concentrations of P and Ca compared to their respective adjacent soils. Such characteristics may help to explain the longevity and distinctiveness of the anthrosols in the Amazonian landscape and guide us in recreating soils with sustained high fertility in otherwise nutrient-poor soils in modern times.},

abstract = {Glacier forefields are an ideal playground to investigate the role of development stages of soils on the formation of plant-microbe interactions as within the last decades, many alpine glaciers retreated, whereby releasing and exposing parent material for soil development. Especially the status of macronutrients like nitrogen differs between soils of different development stages in these environments and may influence plant growth significantly. Thus, in this study, we reconstructed major parts of the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil/root system of Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) HEYWOOD: as well as the corresponding bulk soil by quantifying functional genes of nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrogen mineralisation (chiA, aprA), nitrification (amoA AOB, amoA AOA) and denitrification (nirS, nirK and nosZ) in a 10-year and a 120-year ice-free soil of the Damma glacier forefield. We linked the results to the ammonium and nitrate concentrations of the soils as well as to the nitrogen and carbon status of the plants. The experiment was performed in a greenhouse simulating the climatic conditions of the glacier forefield. Samples were taken after 7 and 13 weeks of plant growth. Highest nifH gene abundance in connection with lowest nitrogen content of L. alpina was observed in the 10-year soil after 7 weeks of plant growth, demonstrating the important role of associative nitrogen fixation for plant development in this soil. In contrast, in the 120-year soil copy numbers of genes involved in denitrification, mainly nosZ were increased after 13 weeks of plant growth, indicating an overall increased microbial activity status as well as higher concentrations of nitrate in this soil.},

abstract = {Global environmental changes are expected to impact the abundance of plants and animals aboveground, but comparably little is known about the responses of belowground organisms. Using meta-analysis, we synthesized results from over 75 manipulative experiments in order to test for patterns in the effects of elevated CO(2), warming, and altered precipitation on the abundance of soil biota related to taxonomy, body size, feeding habits, ecosystem type, local climate, treatment magnitude and duration, and greenhouse CO(2) enrichment. We found that the positive effect size of elevated CO(2) on the abundance of soil biota diminished with time, whereas the negative effect size of warming and positive effect size of precipitation intensified with time. Trophic group, body size, and experimental approaches best explained the responses of soil biota to elevated CO(2), whereas local climate and ecosystem type best explained responses to warming and altered precipitation. The abundance of microflora and microfauna, and particularly detritivores, increased with elevated CO(2), indicative of microbial C limitation under ambient CO(2). However, the effects of CO(2) were smaller in field studies than in greenhouse studies and were not significant for higher trophic levels. Effects of warming did not depend on taxon or body size, but reduced abundances were more likely to occur at the colder and drier sites. Precipitation limited all taxa and trophic groups, particularly in forest ecosystems. Our meta-analysis suggests that the responses of soil biota to global change are predictable and unique for each global change factor.},

abstract = {Species richness, the simplest index of biodiversity, varies greatly over broad spatial scales. Richness-climate relationships often account for >80\% of the spatial variance in richness. However, it has been suggested that richness-climate relationships differ significantly among geographic regions and that there is no globally consistent relationship. This study investigated the global patterns of species and family richness of angiosperms in relation to climate. We found that models relating angiosperm richness to mean annual temperature, annual water deficit, and their interaction or models relating richness to annual potential evapotranspiration and water deficit are both globally consistent and very strong and are independent of the diverse evolutionary histories and functional assemblages of plants in different parts of the world. Thus, effects of other factors such as evolutionary history, postglacial dispersal, soil nutrients, topography, or other climatic variables either must be quite minor over broad scales (because there is little residual variation left to explain) or they must be strongly collinear with global patterns of climate. The correlations shown here must be predicted by any successful hypothesis of mechanisms controlling richness patterns.},

Soil inorganic N content, total plant biomass and delta(15)N values of bulk plant material were significantly lower in the pioneer stage than in the ruderal grass community. The observed delta(15)N differences were rather species- than site-specific. Within both stages, there were also species-specific differences in isotopic composition between above- and belowground plant dry matter. Species-specific delta(15)N signatures may theoretically be explained by (i) isotopic fractionation during microbial-mediated soil N transformations; (ii) isotopic fractionation during plant N uptake or fractionation during plant-mycorrhiza transfer processes; (iii) differences in metabolic pathways and isotopic fractionation within the plant; or (iv) partitioning of available N resources (or pools) among plant groups or differential use of the same resources by different species, which seems to be the most probable route in the present case. A significant influence of N(2)-fixing legumes on the N balance of the surrounding plant community was not detectable. This was confirmed by the results of an independent in situ removal experiment, showing that after 3 years there were no measurable differences in the frequency distribution between plots with and without N(2)-fixing legumes.},

The sensitivity of the nitrate assay decline if the mixture analyzed contains a large excess of nitrite relative to nitrate, for instance, in the case of oxidation products of nitric oxide (NO) in aerated solutions, or in sweat. By this reason nitrite should be removed before the nitrate assay, if [NO2-]>>[NO3-]. Here we lay out an improved method allowing the above limitation to be erased, using sulfamic acid for nitrite removal. We also describe some modifications that enhance the reproducibility of the assay.},

abstract = {Abstract Trade-offs have been put forward as essential to the generation and maintenance of diversity. However, variation in trade-offs is often determined at the molecular level, outside the scope of conventional ecological inquiry. In this study, we propose that understanding the intracellular basis for trade-offs in microbial systems can aid in predicting and interpreting patterns of diversity. First, we show how laboratory experiments and mathematical models have unveiled the hidden intracellular mechanisms underlying trade-offs key to microbial diversity: (i) metabolic and regulatory trade-offs in bacteria and yeast; (ii) life-history trade-offs in bacterial viruses. Next, we examine recent studies of marine microbes that have taken steps toward reconciling the molecular and the ecological views of trade-offs, despite the challenges in doing so in natural settings. Finally, we suggest avenues for research where mathematical modelling, experiments and studies of natural microbial communities provide a unique opportunity to integrate studies of diversity across multiple scales.},

@article{Wardle2008,
abstract = {There has been considerable recent interest in how human-induced species loss affects community and ecosystem properties. These effects are particularly apparent when a commercially valuable species is harvested from an ecosystem, such as occurs through single-tree harvesting or selective logging of desired timber species in natural forests. In New Zealand mixed-species rain forests, single-tree harvesting of the emergent gymnosperm Dacrydium cupressinum, or rimu, has been widespread. This harvesting has been contentious in part because of possible ecological impacts of Dacrydium removal on the remainder of the forest, but many of these effects remain unexplored. We identified an area where an unintended 40-year "removal experiment" had been set up that involved selective extraction of individual Dacrydium trees. We measured aboveground and belowground variables at set distances from both individual live trees and stumps of trees harvested 40 years ago. Live trees had effects both above and below ground by affecting diversity and cover of several components of the vegetation (usually negatively), promoting soil C sequestration, enhancing ratios of soil C:P and N:P, and affecting community structure of soil microflora. These effects extended to 8 m from the tree base and were likely caused by poor-quality litter and humus produced by the trees. Measurements for the stumps revealed strong legacy effects of prior presence of trees on some properties (e.g., cover by understory herbs and ferns, soil C sequestration, soil C:P and N:P ratios), but not others (e.g., soil fungal biomass, soil N concentration). These results suggest that the legacy of prior presence of Dacrydium may remain for several decades or centuries, and certainly well over 40 years. They also demonstrate that, while large Dacrydium individuals (and their removal) may have important effects in their immediate proximity, within a forest, these effects should only be important in localized patches containing high densities of large trees. Finally, this study emphasizes that deliberate extraction of a particular tree species from a forest can exert influences both above and below ground if the removed species has a different functional role than that of the other plant species present.},

The method is based on the isotopic analysis of nitrous oxide (N20) generated from nitrate by denitrifying bacteria that lack N2O-reductase activity. The isotopic composition of both nitrogen and oxygen from nitrate are accessible in this way. In this first of two companion manuscripts, we describe the basic protocol and results for the nitrogen isotopes. The precision of the method is better than 0.2/1000 (1 SD) at concentrations of nitrate down to 1 microM, and the nitrogen isotopic differences among various standards and samples are accurately reproduced. For samples with 1 microM nitrate or more, the blank of the method is less than 10\% of the signal size, and various approaches may reduce it further.},

abstract = {We report a three-phase chromatographic method for the separation and analysis of delta(13)C values of underivatized amino acids from biological proteins (keratin, collagen, and casein) using liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC-IRMS). Both precision and accuracy of delta(13)C values for standard amino acid mixtures over the range of approximately 8 to 1320 ng of carbon per amino acid on the column were assessed. The precision of delta(13)C values of amino acids was found to be better at higher concentrations, whereas accuracy improved at lower concentrations. The optimal performance for this method was achieved with between 80 and 660 ng of carbon of each amino acid on the column. At amino acid amounts lower than 20 ng of carbon on the column, precision and accuracy may become compromised. The application of this new three-phase chromatographic technique will allow the analysis of delta(13)C of amino acids to be carried out as a routine method and benefit fields of research such as biomedicine, forensics, ecology, nutrition, and palaeodiet reconstruction in archaeology.},

@article{Schmidt2001,
abstract = {Oxygen atoms in plant products originate from CO(2), H(2)O and O(2), precursors with quite different delta18O values. Furthermore their incorporation by different reactions implies isotope effects. On this base the resulting non-statistical 18O distributions in natural compounds are discussed. The delta18O value of cellulose is correlated to that of the leaf water, and the observed 18O enrichment (approximately +27 per thousand) is generally attributed to an equilibrium isotope effect between carbonyl groups and water. However, as soluble and heterotrophically synthesised carbohydrates show other correlations, a non-statistical 18O distribution - originating from individual biosynthetic reactions - is postulated for carbohydrates. Similarly, the delta18O values of organic acids, carbonyl compounds, alcohols and esters indicate water-correlated, but individual 18O abundances (e.g. O from acyl groups approximately +19\% above water), depending upon origin and biosyntheses. Alcoholic groups introduced by monooxygenase reactions, e.g. in sterols and phenols, show delta18O values near +5 per thousand, in agreement with an assumed isotope fractionation factor of approximately 1.02 on the reaction with atmospheric oxygen (delta18O=+23.5 per thousand). Correspondingly, a "thermodynamically ordered isotope distribution" is only observed for oxygen in some functional groups correlated to an origin from CO(2) and H(2)O, not from O(2). The individual isotopic increments of functional groups permit the prediction of global delta18O values of natural compounds on the basis of their biosynthesis.},

Phytoplankton includes chemo-organotrophic unicells, colonies and multicellular organisms that depend on symbionts or kleptoplastids for their capacity to photosynthesize. Analyses of physical (transport within cells, diffusion boundary layers, package effect, turgor, and vertical movements) and biotic (grazing, viruses and other parasitoids) factors indicate potential ecological constraints and opportunities that differ among the life forms. There are also variations among life forms in elemental stoichiometry and in allometric relations between biovolume and specific growth. While many of these factors probably have ecological and evolutionary significance, work is needed to establish those that are most important, warranting explicit description in models. Other factors setting limitations on growth rate (selecting slow-growing species) await elucidation.},

@article{Hobbie2006a,
abstract = {When soil nitrogen is in short supply, most terrestrial plants form symbioses with fungi (mycorrhizae): hyphae take up soil nitrogen, transport it into plant roots, and receive plant sugars in return. In ecosystems, the transfers within the pathway fractionate nitrogen isotopes so that the natural abundance of 15N in fungi differs from that in their host plants by as much as 12\% per hundred. Here we present a new method to quantify carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the symbiosis based on the fractionation against 15N during transfer of nitrogen from fungi to plant roots. We tested this method, which is based on the mass balance of 15N, with data from arctic Alaska where the nitrogen cycle is well studied. Mycorrhizal fungi provided 61-86\% of the nitrogen in plants; plants provided 8-17\% of their photosynthetic carbon to the fungi for growth and respiration. This method of analysis avoids the disturbance of the soil-microbe-root relationship caused by collecting samples, mixing the soil, or changing substrate concentrations. This analytical technique also can be applied to other nitrogen-limited ecosystems, such as many temperate and boreal forests, to quantify the importance for terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling of nutrient transfers mediated by mycorrhizae at the plant-soil interface.},

abstract = {Nitrogen concentrations in plant tissues can vary as a function of resource availability. Altered rates of plant growth and development under varying resource availabilities were examined to determine their effects on changes in whole-plant N use efficiency (NUE). Three species of old-field annuals were grown at broadly varying light, nutrient and water levels, and four species at varying atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Study results show highly variable N accrual rates when expressed as a function of plant age or size, but similar patterns of whole-plant N versus non-N biomass accrual over a wide range of environmental conditions. However, severely light-limited plants showed increased N versus biomass accrual for two of three species, and severely nutrient-limited plants had decreased N versus biomass accrual for all species. Whole-plant N accrual versus age and N versus biomass accrual increased under saturating water for two of three species. A marginally significant, modest decrease in N versus biomass accrual was found at high CO2 levels for two of four species. Physiological adjustments in NUE, expressed as N versus biomass accrual, were limited to environments with severely limited or overabundant resources.},

However, these assays can either be time consuming or require specialized equipment (e.g., nitrate reductase, chemiluminescent detector). We have developed a method for simultaneous evaluation of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in a microtiter plate format. The principle of this assay is reduction of nitrate by vanadium(III) combined with detection by the acidic Griess reaction. This assay is sensitive to 0.5 microM NO(-)(3) and is useful in a variety of fluids including cell culture media, serum, and plasma. S-Nitrosothiols and L-arginine derivatives were found to be potential interfering agents. However, these compounds are generally minor constituents of biological fluids relative to the concentration of nitrate/nitrite. This report introduces a new, convenient assay for the stable oxidation products of nitrogen oxide chemistry in biological samples.},

In plate assay the efficiency of NBRIP was comparable to PVK; however, in broth assay NBRIP consistently demonstrated about 3-fold higher efficiency compared to PVK. The results indicated that the criterion for isolation of phosphate solubilizers based on the formation of visible halo/zone on agar plates is not a reliable technique, as many isolates which did not show any clear zone on agar plates solubilized insoluble inorganic phosphates in liquid medium. It may be concluded that soil microbes should be screened in NBRIP broth assay for the identification of the most efficient phosphate solubilizers.},

@article{Kessler2009,
abstract = {Assessing the overall biological diversity of tropical rain forests is a seemingly insurmountable task for ecologists. Therefore, researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns. Usually, these studies focus on the congruence of alpha diversity (the number of species found per sampling unit) between taxa rather than on beta diversity (turnover of species assemblages between sampling units). Such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that, depending on the taxonomic group considered, can greatly enhance beta diversity at local and landscape scales. We compared alpha and beta diversity of four plant groups (trees, lianas, terrestrial herbs, epiphytic liverworts) and eight animal groups (birds, butterflies, lower canopy ants, lower canopy beetles, dung beetles, bees, wasps, and the parasitoids of the latter two) at 15 sites in Sulawesi, Indonesia, that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity. In total, we recorded 863 species. Patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups. Only 13-17\% of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another, and on average 12-18\% of the variance of beta diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups, although some taxon pairs had higher values (up to 76\% for wasps and their parasitoids). The degree of congruence of patterns of alpha diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness, whereas the indicator value for beta diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling. The indication potential of alpha diversity for beta diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa (7-20\%) and virtually nil between them (0-4\%). We conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of alpha diversity and that patterns of beta diversity can be more congruent. Thus, conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of beta diversity shaping overall diversity patterns.},

abstract = {(14)N-NMR and (31)P-NMR have been used to monitor the in vivo pH in roots, stems, and needles from seedlings of Norway spruce, a typical ammonium-tolerant plant. The vacuolar and cytoplasmic pH measured by (31)P-NMR was found to be c. pH 4.8 and 7.0, respectively, with no significant difference between plants growing with ammonium or nitrate as the N-source. The (1)H-coupled (14) NH 4+ resonance is pH-sensitive: at alkaline pH it is a narrow singlet line and below pH 4 it is an increasing multiplet line with five signals. The pH values in ammonium-containing compartments measured by (14)N-NMR ranged from 3.7 to 3.9, notably lower than the estimated pH values of the P(i) pools. This suggests that, in seedlings of Norway spruce, ammonium is stored in vacuoles with low pH possibly to protect the seedlings against the toxic effects of ammonium ( NH 4+) or ammonia (NH3). It was also found that concentrations of malate were 3-6 times higher in stems than in roots and needles, with nitrate-grown plants containing more malate than plants grown with ammonium.},

abstract = {The discovery of ammonia oxidation by mesophilic and thermophilic Crenarchaeota and the widespread distribution of these organisms in marine and terrestrial environments indicated an important role for them in the global nitrogen cycle. However, very little is known about their physiology or their contribution to nitrification. Here we report oligotrophic ammonia oxidation kinetics and cellular characteristics of the mesophilic crenarchaeon 'Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus' strain SCM1. Unlike characterized ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, SCM1 is adapted to life under extreme nutrient limitation, sustaining high specific oxidation rates at ammonium concentrations found in open oceans. Its half-saturation constant (K(m) = 133 nM total ammonium) and substrate threshold (<or=10 nM) closely resemble kinetics of in situ nitrification in marine systems and directly link ammonia-oxidizing Archaea to oligotrophic nitrification. The remarkably high specific affinity for reduced nitrogen (68,700 l per g cells per h) of SCM1 suggests that Nitrosopumilus-like ammonia-oxidizing Archaea could successfully compete with heterotrophic bacterioplankton and phytoplankton. Together these findings support the hypothesis that nitrification is more prevalent in the marine nitrogen cycle than accounted for in current biogeochemical models.},

This methodology constitutes a powerful new culture-independent method for investigating microbial communities in the environment. The information obtained is highly complementary to that obtained from gene-probe-based methods, and considerable possibilities exist to extend this methodology to include other biochemical components of microorganisms.},

abstract = {15N/14N isotope ratios are widely used to study processes and systems involving amino acids. Nitrogen isotope fractionation in biological processes occurs primarily at sites of bond-breaking and formation; the finest discrimination for "isotopic fingerprinting" and studies of isotopic fluxes is thus obtained at the position-specific level. While there are numerous reports of natural intramolecular carbon isotope variability, there are no literature reports of 15N/14N position-specific isotopic analysis (N-PSIA) of biologically relevant molecules. We report a methodology for high-precision N-PSIA of four polynitrogenous alpha-amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, lysine, histidine) and the first survey of natural intramolecular 15N/14N in these biomolecules. Selective liberation of N-atoms from multiple commercial standards of each parent amino acid was achieved by an appropriate enzymatic reaction or by acid hydrolysis. 15N/14N measurements were performed on N-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester derivatives of the parent amino acids and their analogues by gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and the average precision for replicate injections was found to be SD(delta15N) = 0.3\%. Position-specific delta15N values of the parent amino acid were directly observed or indirectly calculated using mass balance. The average precision obtained for directly measured positions was SD(delta15N) = 0.2-0.4\%. The average precision for indirectly obtained positions was SD(delta15N) = 0.6-1.3\% as a result of propagation of errors. Enrichment in the side chain-N with respect to the peptide-N was observed in nearly all of the amino acid sources, most notably in asparagine (average delta delta(side-peptide) = + 11\%), which may be indicative of its method of production. In some cases, it was possible to distinguish commercial sources by N-PSIA that could not be distinguished at the compound-specific level.},

It has been hypothesized that Roridula leaves absorb nitrogen from the faeces of obligately associated, carnivorous hemipterans. But rapid movement across the leaf surfaces of most plant leaves is prevented by the presence of an impermeable cuticle. However, in carnivorous plants, cuticular gaps or pores in digestive/absorptive cells allow rapid movement across the leaf surface. Recently, it was suggested that the hemipteran-plant interaction constituted a new pathway for plant carnivory. Here, a further adaptation to this pathway is described by demonstrating how Roridula plants probably absorb hemipteran faeces rapidly through their leaf cuticles.},

All fungal ITS sequences in GenBank were classified as either identified to species level or insufficiently identified and compared using BLAST. The results are made available as a biweekly updated web service that can be queried to retrieve all insufficiently identified sequences (IIS) associated with any fungal genus. The most commonly available annotation items in GenBank are isolation source (55\%); country of origin (50\%); and specific host (38\%). The molecular sampling of fungi shows a bias towards North America, Europe, China, and Japan whereas vast geographical areas remain effectively unexplored. Mycorrhizal and parasitic genera are on average associated with more IIS than are saprophytic taxa. Glomus, Alternaria, and Tomentella are the genera represented by the highest number of insufficiently identified ITS sequences in GenBank. The web service presented (http://andromeda.botany.gu.se/emerencia.html\#genus\_search) offers new means, particularly for mycorrhizal and plant pathogenic fungi, to examine the IIS in GenBank in a taxon-oriented framework and to explore their metadata in an easily accessible and time-efficient manner.},

The SD of delta(18)O measurement by the TDL was +/- 0.2 per thousand and close to that of traditional mass spectrometers. Further, delta(18)O(R) values at isotopic steady state were comparable to those obtained using traditional flask sampling and mass spectrometric techniques for R. communis grown and measured in similar environmental conditions. As well as higher temporal resolution, the online TDL method described here has a number of advantages over mass spectrometric techniques. At isotopic steady state among plants grown at high light, the "one-way flux" model was required to accurately predict delta(18)O(R). A comparison of measurements and the model suggests that plants grown under low-light conditions have either a lower proportion of chloroplast CO(2) that isotopically equilibrates with chloroplast water, or more enriched delta(18)O of CO(2) in the chloroplast that has not equilibrated with local water. The high temporal resolution of isotopic measurements allowed the first measurements of delta(18)O(R) when stomatal conductance was rapidly changing. Under non-steady-state conditions, delta(18)O(R) varied between 50 and 220 per thousand for leaves of plants grown under different light and water environments, and varied by as much as 100 per thousand within 10 min for a single leaf. Stomatal conductance ranged from 0.001 to 1.586 mol m(-2) s(-1), and had an important influence on delta(18)O(R) under non-steady-state conditions not only via effects on leaf water H(2) (18)O enrichment, but also via effects on the rate of the one-way fluxes of CO(2) into and out of the leaf.},

abstract = {Modern agriculture has accelerated biological methane and nitrogen cycling on a global scale. Freshwater sediments often receive increased downward fluxes of nitrate from agricultural runoff and upward fluxes of methane generated by anaerobic decomposition. In theory, prokaryotes should be capable of using nitrate to oxidize methane anaerobically, but such organisms have neither been observed in nature nor isolated in the laboratory. Microbial oxidation of methane is thus believed to proceed only with oxygen or sulphate. Here we show that the direct, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to denitrification of nitrate is possible. A microbial consortium, enriched from anoxic sediments, oxidized methane to carbon dioxide coupled to denitrification in the complete absence of oxygen. This consortium consisted of two microorganisms, a bacterium representing a phylum without any cultured species and an archaeon distantly related to marine methanotrophic Archaea. The detection of relatives of these prokaryotes in different freshwater ecosystems worldwide indicates that the reaction presented here may make a substantial contribution to biological methane and nitrogen cycles.},

abstract = {The uptake of nitrogen (N) by roots is known to change with supply in a manner that suggests that the N status of plants is somehow sensed and can feedback to regulate this process. The most abundant source of N in soils for crops is nitrate. Uptake systems for nitrate, ammonium, and amino acids are present in the roots of most plants including crops. As nitrate is assimilated via conversion to nitrite, then ammonium into amino acids, it has been suggested that the internal pools of amino acids within plants may indicate nitrogen status by providing a signal that can regulate nitrate uptake by the plant. In support of this idea, both nitrate and ammonium influx and transporter transcript were shown to decrease in root tissue treated with exogenously applied amino acids. Several different amino acids have been tested for their effects on influx and transcription and glutamine was most effective. The feedback regulation occurs by changing the expression of transporters, but may also involve the post-translational modification of proteins. For example, some of the cytoplasmic enzymes responsible for nitrate assimilation are regulated by phosphorylation and binding of a 14-3-3 protein. The effects of treating plants with glutamine have been examined, first to identify the uptake of the amino acid and then to measure tissue nitrate reductase activity and cellular pools of nitrate. These results are reviewed in terms of feedback regulation and the putative cell sensing systems for N status including a possible specific role for cytosolic nitrate.},

abstract = {The crown architectures of 11 Psychotria species native to Barro Colorado Island, Panama were reconstructed from field measurements of leaf and branch geometry with the three-dimensional simulation model Y-plant. The objective was to assess the role of species differences in architecture in light capture and carbon gain in their natural understory environment. When species were grouped according to their putative light environment preference, the shade tolerant species were found to have a small but significantly higher efficiency of light capture for both diffuse and direct light as compared to the light demanding species. Within each grouping, however, there were few significant differences in light capture efficiency among species. The lower efficiencies of light demanding species was due to slightly higher self-shading and slightly lower angular efficiencies. Simulations of whole plant assimilation showed that light demanding species had greater daily assimilation in both direct and diffuse light due to the significantly greater light availability in the sites where light demanding species were found, as compared to those where shade tolerant species occurred. Among light demanding species, the above ground relative growth rate measured over a 1-year period by applying allometric equations for mass versus linear dimensions, was positively correlated with diffuse PFD and with mean daily assimilation estimated from Y-plant. For the shade tolerant plants, there was no significant correlation between RGR and mean daily assimilation or with any measure of light availability, probably because they occurred over a much narrower range of light environments. Overall, the results reveal a strong convergence in light capture efficiencies among the Psychotria species at lower values than previously observed in understory plants using similar approaches. Constraints imposed by other crown functions such as hydraulics and biomechanical support may place upper limits on light capture efficiency.},

Statistical procedures are based on analysis of nested linear models and a residual permutation procedure (RPP) that is employed to evaluate probabilities associated with test statistics.

First, we developed a test for differences in centroid location and dispersion of delta13C and delta15N values within and among groups of isotopic data. Second, we evaluated magnitude and direction of change in centroid position (termed "path") of a pair of isotopic samples separated in space/time relative to paths of other paired sample sets. Third, we compared attributes of path trajectories (size, direction, and shape) over sample sets containing more than two samples to provide a quantitative description of how patterns of isotopic ratios change in response to spatial and temporal gradients. Examples are limited to the bivariate case (delta13C-delta15N biplots), but the statistical method can readily be applied to univariate and multivariate cases.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of bulk precipitation and throughfall were analyzed, during a 1-year period (2002), in rural-urban-industry gradients with similar forest cover (Eucalyptus spp.) in southern Brazil (Rio Grande and Porto Alegre cities). Values of pH varied from 5.0-5.1 in rural to 5.4-6.1 in industrial sites, and were intermediate in urban sites. The major ions in bulk precipitation were Na+, Cl-, NH+(4), NO-(3), and PO(3-)(4), and concentrations increased in urban and industrial sites. Principal component analysis identified the local main anthropogenic sources. Estimated annual amounts of dry deposition were generally greater in both industrial and urban sites than in rural sites. Areas close to industrial activity showed greater S and N total deposition (10.4-10.9 and 20.2-30.6 kg/ha, respectively) than in urban (3.4-7.3 and 14.6-24.1 kg/ha) and in rural (1.7-2.6 and 8.9-12.1 kg/ha) sites. Annual deposition of Ca and P varied from 0.6 and 3.0 kg/ha in rural to 45.4 and 32.4 kg/ha in industrial sites, maximum values being observed closed to the phosphate fertilizer plant of Rio Grande. Deposition in urban and industrial sites may be balanced by the alkaline cations, as bulk precipitation pH varied from 5.4 to 6.1, and was greater than in rural sites (5.0-5.1).},

abstract = {Common PCR assays for quantification of fungi in living plants cannot be used to study saprophytic colonization of fungi because plant decomposition releases PCR-inhibiting substances and saprophytes degrade the plant DNA which could serve as internal standard. The microsatellite PCR assays presented here overcome these problems by spiking samples prior to DNA extraction with mycelium of a reference strain. PCR with fluorescent primers co-amplifies microsatellite fragments of different length from target and reference strains. These fragments were separated in a capillary sequencer with fluorescence detection. The target/reference ratio of fluorescence signal was used to calculate target biomass in the sample. Such PCR assays were developed for the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing wheat and maize pathogen Fusarium graminearum and the biocontrol agent Trichoderma atroviride, using new microsatellite markers. In contrast to real-time PCR assays, the novel PCR assays showed reliable fungal biomass quantification in samples with differentially decomposed plant tissue. The PCR assays were used to quantify the two fungi after competitive colonization of autoclaved maize leaf tissue in microcosms. Using a DON-producing F. graminearum wild-type strain and its nontoxigenic mutant we found no evidence for a role of DON production in F. graminearum defense against T. atroviride. The presence of T. atroviride resulted in a 36\% lower wild-type DON production per biomass.},

abstract = {We describe an open leaf gas exchange system coupled to a tunable diode laser (TDL) spectroscopy system enabling measurement of the leaf respiratory CO(2) flux and its associated carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C(Rl)) every 3 min. The precision of delta(13)C(Rl) measurement is comparable to that of traditional mass spectrometry techniques. delta(13)C(Rl) from castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) leaves tended to be positively related to the ratio of CO(2) produced to O(2) consumed [respiratory quotient (RQ)] after 24-48 h of prolonged darkness, in support of existing models. Further, the apparent fractionation between respiratory substrates and respired CO(2) within 1-8 h after the start of the dark period was similar to previous observations. In subsequent experiments, R. communis plants were grown under variable water availability to provide a range in delta(13)C of recently fixed carbohydrate. In leaves exposed to high light levels prior to the start of the dark period, CO(2) respired by leaves was up to 11 per thousand more enriched than phloem sap sugars within the first 10-15 min after plants had been moved from the light into the dark. The (13)C enrichment in respired CO(2) then decreased rapidly to within 3-7 per thousand of phloem sap after 30-60 min in the dark. This strong enrichment was not observed if light levels were low prior to the start of the dark period. Measurements of RQ confirmed that carbohydrates were the likely respiratory substrate for plants (RQ > 0.8) within the first 60 min after illumination. The strong (13)C enrichment that followed a high light-to-dark transition coincided with high respiration rates, suggesting that so-called light-enhanced dark respiration (LEDR) is fed by (13)C-enriched metabolites.},

abstract = {A group-specific primer, F243 (positions 226 to 243, Escherichia coli numbering), was developed by comparison of sequences of genes encoding 16S rRNA (16S rDNA) for the detection of actinomycetes in the environment with PCR and temperature or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE or DGGE, respectively). The specificity of the forward primer in combination with different reverse ones was tested with genomic DNA from a variety of bacterial strains. Most actinomycetes investigated could be separated by TGGE and DGGE, with both techniques giving similar results. Two strategies were employed to study natural microbial communities. First, we used the selective amplification of actinomycete sequences (E. coli positions 226 to 528) for direct analysis of the products in denaturing gradients. Second, a nested PCR providing actinomycete-specific fragments (E. coli positions 226 to 1401) was used which served as template for a PCR when conserved primers were used. The products (E. coli positions 968 to 1401) of this indirect approach were then separated by use of gradient gels. Both approaches allowed detection of actinomycete communities in soil. The second strategy allowed the estimation of the relative abundance of actinomycetes within the bacterial community. Mixtures of PCR-derived 16S rDNA fragments were used as model communities consisting of five actinomycetes and five other bacterial species. Actinomycete products were obtained over a 100-fold dilution range of the actinomycete DNA in the model community by specific PCR; detection of the diluted actinomycete DNA was not possible when conserved primers were used. The methods tested for detection were applied to monitor actinomycete community changes in potato rhizosphere and to investigate actinomycete diversity in different soils.},

abstract = {High levels of wet N and acidic deposition were measured in southeast Brazil. In this study we addressed the sensitivity of water bodies and soils to acidification and N deposition in the Piracicaba River basin (12,400 km2). Average acid neutralization capacity (ANC) at 23 river sampling sites varied from 350 to 1800 microeq l(-1). Therefore, rivers and streams in the Piracicaba basin are well buffered, if the lower limit of 200 microeq l(-1) is assumed as an indication of poorly buffered waters. ANC is increased by untreated wastewaters discarded into rivers and streams of the region. Average NO3 concentrations varied from 20 to 70 microeq l(-1). At the most polluted river sites, NO3 concentration is not highest, however, probably due to NO3 reduction and denitrification. Most of the nitrogen in streams is also provided by wastewaters and not by wet deposition. The majority of the soils in the basin, however, are acidic with a low base cation content and high aluminum concentration. Therefore, soils in this basin are poorly buffered and, in areas of forest over sandy soils, acidification may be a problem.},

abstract = {13C-breath tests provide a non-invasive diagnostic method with high patient acceptance. In vivo, human and also bacterial enzyme activities, organ functions and transport processes can be assessed semiquantitatively using breath tests. As the samples can directly be analysed using non-dispersive isotope selective infrared spectrometers or sent to analytical centres by normal mail breath tests can be easily performed also in primary care settings. The 13C-urea breath test which detects a Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach is the most prominent application of stable isotopes. Determination of gastric emptying using test meals labelled with 13C-octanoic or 13C-acetic acid provide reliable results compared to scintigraphy. The clinical use of 13C-breath tests for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is still limited due to expensive substrates and long test periods with many samples. However, the quantification of liver function using hepatically metabolised 13C-substrates is clinically helpful in special indications. The stable isotope technique presents an elegant, non-invasive diagnostic tool promising further options of clinical applications. This review is aimed at providing an overview on the relevant clinical applications of 13C-breath tests.},

abstract = {Southern Ontario receives the highest levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in Canada and there are concerns that forests in the region may be approaching a state of 'N saturation'. In order to evaluate whether potential chemical indices provide evidence of N saturation, 23 hardwood plots were sampled along a modeled N-deposition gradient ranging from 9.3 to 12.8 kg/ha/year. All plots were dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and foliar N and foliar delta(15)N were positively correlated with modeled N deposition. However, forest floor N content and the C:N ratio were unrelated to N deposition, but were instead related to soil pH and annual temperature; lower C:N ratios and higher N content in the forest floor were found at the most acidic sites in the cooler, northern part of the study region despite lower N deposition. Likewise, delta(15)N values in surface mineral soil and the (15)N enrichment factor of foliage (delta(15)N foliage - delta(15)N soil) are correlated to soil pH and temperature and not N deposition. Further, potential N mineralization, ammonification, and nitrification in Ontario maple stands were highest in the northern part of the region with the lowest modeled N deposition. Nitrogen cycling in soil appears to be primarily influenced by the N status of the forest floor and other soil properties rather than N deposition, indicating that chemical indices in soil in these hardwood plots may not provide an early indicator of N saturation.},

Direct high-throughput sequencing of a DNA extract from this fossil has thus far yielded over one million base pairs of hominoid nuclear DNA sequences. Comparison with the human and chimpanzee genomes reveals that modern human and Neanderthal DNA sequences diverged on average about 500,000 years ago. Existing technology and fossil resources are now sufficient to initiate a Neanderthal genome-sequencing effort.},

abstract = {Two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF-MS) is a promising technique to overcome limits of complex metabolome analysis using one dimensional GC-TOF-MS. Especially at the stage of data export and data mining, however, convenient procedures to cope with the complexity of GCxGC-TOF-MS data are still in development. Here, we present a high sample throughput protocol exploiting first and second retention index for spectral library search and subsequent construction of a high dimensional data matrix useful for statistical analysis. The method was applied to the analysis of (13)C-labelling experiments in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We developed a rapid sampling and extraction procedure for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii laboratory strain (CC503), a cell wall deficient mutant. By testing all published quenching protocols we observed dramatic metabolite leakage rates for certain metabolites. To circumvent metabolite leakage, samples were directly quenched and analyzed without separation of the medium. The growth medium was adapted to this rapid sampling protocol to avoid interference with GCxGC-TOF-MS analysis. To analyse batches of samples a new software tool, MetMax, was implemented which extracts the isotopomer matrix from stable isotope labelling experiments together with the first and second retention index (RI1 and RI2). To exploit RI1 and RI2 for metabolite identification we used the Golm metabolome database (GMD [1] with RI1/RI2-reference spectra and new search algorithms. Using those techniques we analysed the dynamics of (13)CO(2) and (13)C-acetate uptake in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells in two different steady states namely photoautotroph and mixotroph growth conditions.},

abstract = {This study evaluates a novel method for extracting roots from soil samples and applies it to estimate standing crop root mass (+/- confidence intervals) in an eastern Amazon rainforest. Roots were manually extracted from soil cores over a period of 40 min, which was split into 10 min time intervals. The pattern of cumulative extraction over time was used to predict root extraction beyond 40 min. A maximum-likelihood approach was used to calculate confidence intervals. The temporal prediction method added 21-32\% to initial estimates of standing crop root mass. According to predictions, complete manual root extraction from 18 samples would have taken c. 239 h, compared with 12 h using the prediction method. Uncertainties (percentage difference between mean, and 10th and 90th percentiles) introduced by the prediction method were small (12-15\%), compared with uncertainties caused by spatial variation in root mass (72-191\%, for nine samples per plot surveyed). This method provides a way of increasing the number of root samples processed per unit time, without compromising measurement accuracy.},

abstract = {Northern Hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions suggest that the late twentieth century was warmer than any other time during the past 500 years and possibly any time during the past 1,300 years (refs 1, 2). These temperature reconstructions are based largely on terrestrial records from extra-tropical or high-elevation sites; however, global average surface temperature changes closely follow those of the global tropics, which are 75\% ocean. In particular, the tropical Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) represents a major heat reservoir that both influences global atmospheric circulation and responds to remote northern high-latitude forcings. Here we present a decadally resolved continuous sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction from the IPWP that spans the past two millennia and overlaps the instrumental record, enabling both a direct comparison of proxy data to the instrumental record and an evaluation of past changes in the context of twentieth century trends. Our record from the Makassar Strait, Indonesia, exhibits trends that are similar to a recent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction. Reconstructed SST was, however, within error of modern values from about ad 1000 to ad 1250, towards the end of the Medieval Warm Period. SSTs during the Little Ice Age (approximately ad 1550-1850) were variable, and approximately 0.5 to 1 degrees C colder than modern values during the coldest intervals. A companion reconstruction of delta(18)O of sea water-a sea surface salinity and hydrology indicator-indicates a tight coupling with the East Asian monsoon system and remote control of IPWP hydrology on centennial-millennial timescales, rather than a dominant influence from local SST variation.},

Yet the direct measurements of root activity needed to test this hypothesis are rare. • Here, we injected deuterated water into four soil depths, at four times of year, to measure the vertical and horizontal location of water uptake by trees and grasses in a mesic savanna in Kruger National Park, South Africa. • Trees absorbed 24, 59, 14 and 4\% of tracer from the 5, 20, 50, and 120  cm depths, respectively, while grasses absorbed 61, 29, 9 and 0.3\% of tracer from the same depths. Only 44\% of root mass was in the top 20 cm. Trees absorbed tracer under and beyond their crowns, while 98\% of tracer absorbed by grasses came from directly under the stem. • Trees and grasses partitioned soil resources (20 vs 5  cm), but this partitioning did not reflect, as suggested by the two-layer hypothesis, the ability of trees to access deep soil water that was unavailable to grasses. Because root mass was a poor indicator of root activity, our results highlight the importance of precise root activity measurements.},

abstract = {Linking functional traits to plant growth is critical for scaling attributes of organisms to the dynamics of ecosystems and for understanding how selection shapes integrated botanical phenotypes. However, a general mechanistic theory showing how traits specifically influence carbon and biomass flux within and across plants is needed. Building on foundational work on relative growth rate, recent work on functional trait spectra, and metabolic scaling theory, here we derive a generalized trait-based model of plant growth. In agreement with a wide variety of empirical data, our model uniquely predicts how key functional traits interact to regulate variation in relative growth rate, the allometric growth normalizations for both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and the quantitative form of several functional trait spectra relationships. The model also provides a general quantitative framework to incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships and hence to unite functional trait spectra with theories of relative growth rate, and metabolic scaling. We apply the model to calculate carbon use efficiency. This often ignored trait, which may influence variation in relative growth rate, appears to vary directionally across geographic gradients. Together, our results show how both quantitative plant traits and the geometry of vascular transport networks can be merged into a common scaling theory. Our model provides a framework for predicting not only how traits covary within an integrated allometric phenotype but also how trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth and carbon flux within and across diverse ecosystems.},

Little is known, however, about the structure and richness of different fungal communities and the distribution of functional ecological groups (pathogens, saprobes and symbionts). * Here, we assessed the fungal diversity in six different forest soils using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1). No less than 166 350 ITS reads were obtained from all samples. In each forest soil sample (4 g), approximately 30 000 reads were recovered, corresponding to around 1000 molecular operational taxonomic units. * Most operational taxonomic units (81\%) belonged to the Dikarya subkingdom (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Richness, abundance and taxonomic analyses identified the Agaricomycetes as the dominant fungal class. The ITS-1 sequences (73\%) analysed corresponded to only 26 taxa. The most abundant operational taxonomic units showed the highest sequence similarity to Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptococcus podzolicus, Lactarius sp. and Scleroderma sp. * This study validates the effectiveness of high-throughput 454 sequencing technology for the survey of soil fungal diversity. The large proportion of unidentified sequences, however, calls for curated sequence databases. The use of pyrosequencing on soil samples will accelerate the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal communities in forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {delta(15)N and total nitrogen content of above- and belowground tissues of 13 plant species from two successional stages (open pioneer community and ruderal grass stage) of a dry acidic grassland in Southern Germany were analysed, in order to evaluate whether resource use partitioning by niche separation and N input by N(2)-fixing legumes are potential determinants for species coexistence and successional changes. Within each stage, plants from plots with different legume cover were compared. Soil inorganic N content, total plant biomass and delta(15)N values of bulk plant material were significantly lower in the pioneer stage than in the ruderal grass community. The observed delta(15)N differences were rather species- than site-specific. Within both stages, there were also species-specific differences in isotopic composition between above- and belowground plant dry matter. Species-specific delta(15)N signatures may theoretically be explained by (i) isotopic fractionation during microbial-mediated soil N transformations; (ii) isotopic fractionation during plant N uptake or fractionation during plant-mycorrhiza transfer processes; (iii) differences in metabolic pathways and isotopic fractionation within the plant; or (iv) partitioning of available N resources (or pools) among plant groups or differential use of the same resources by different species, which seems to be the most probable route in the present case. A significant influence of N(2)-fixing legumes on the N balance of the surrounding plant community was not detectable. This was confirmed by the results of an independent in situ removal experiment, showing that after 3 years there were no measurable differences in the frequency distribution between plots with and without N(2)-fixing legumes.},

abstract = {13C-breath tests provide a non-invasive diagnostic method with high patient acceptance. In vivo, human and also bacterial enzyme activities, organ functions and transport processes can be assessed semiquantitatively using breath tests. As the samples can directly be analysed using non-dispersive isotope selective infrared spectrometers or sent to analytical centres by normal mail breath tests can be easily performed also in primary care settings. The 13C-urea breath test which detects a Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach is the most prominent application of stable isotopes. Determination of gastric emptying using test meals labelled with 13C-octanoic or 13C-acetic acid provide reliable results compared to scintigraphy. The clinical use of 13C-breath tests for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is still limited due to expensive substrates and long test periods with many samples. However, the quantification of liver function using hepatically metabolised 13C-substrates is clinically helpful in special indications. The stable isotope technique presents an elegant, non-invasive diagnostic tool promising further options of clinical applications. This review is aimed at providing an overview on the relevant clinical applications of 13C-breath tests.},

abstract = {(14)N-NMR and (31)P-NMR have been used to monitor the in vivo pH in roots, stems, and needles from seedlings of Norway spruce, a typical ammonium-tolerant plant. The vacuolar and cytoplasmic pH measured by (31)P-NMR was found to be c. pH 4.8 and 7.0, respectively, with no significant difference between plants growing with ammonium or nitrate as the N-source. The (1)H-coupled (14) NH 4+ resonance is pH-sensitive: at alkaline pH it is a narrow singlet line and below pH 4 it is an increasing multiplet line with five signals. The pH values in ammonium-containing compartments measured by (14)N-NMR ranged from 3.7 to 3.9, notably lower than the estimated pH values of the P(i) pools. This suggests that, in seedlings of Norway spruce, ammonium is stored in vacuoles with low pH possibly to protect the seedlings against the toxic effects of ammonium ( NH 4+) or ammonia (NH3). It was also found that concentrations of malate were 3-6 times higher in stems than in roots and needles, with nitrate-grown plants containing more malate than plants grown with ammonium.},

abstract = {*Most plants suffer some degree of herbivore attack and many actively defend themselves against such an event. However, while such defence is generally assumed to be costly, it has sometimes proved difficult to demonstrate the costs of defensive compounds. *Here, we present a method for analysing growth rates which allows the effects of variation in initial plant size to be properly accounted for and apply it to 30 lines from a recombinant inbred population of Arabidopsis thaliana. We then relate different measures of relative growth rate (RGR) to damage caused by a specialist lepidopteran insect and to levels of putative defensive compounds measured on the same lines. *We show that seed size variation within the recombinant inbred population is large enough to generate differences in RGR, even when no other physiological differences exist. However, once size-standardized, RGR was positively correlated with herbivore damage (fast-growing lines suffered more damage) and was negatively correlated with the concentration of several glucosinolate compounds. *We conclude that defensive compounds do have a growth cost and that the production of such compounds results in reduced herbivore damage. However, size standardization of RGR was essential to uncovering the growth costs of defensive compounds.},

abstract = {High levels of wet N and acidic deposition were measured in southeast Brazil. In this study we addressed the sensitivity of water bodies and soils to acidification and N deposition in the Piracicaba River basin (12,400 km2). Average acid neutralization capacity (ANC) at 23 river sampling sites varied from 350 to 1800 microeq l(-1). Therefore, rivers and streams in the Piracicaba basin are well buffered, if the lower limit of 200 microeq l(-1) is assumed as an indication of poorly buffered waters. ANC is increased by untreated wastewaters discarded into rivers and streams of the region. Average NO3 concentrations varied from 20 to 70 microeq l(-1). At the most polluted river sites, NO3 concentration is not highest, however, probably due to NO3 reduction and denitrification. Most of the nitrogen in streams is also provided by wastewaters and not by wet deposition. The majority of the soils in the basin, however, are acidic with a low base cation content and high aluminum concentration. Therefore, soils in this basin are poorly buffered and, in areas of forest over sandy soils, acidification may be a problem.},

abstract = {A whole-tree chamber (WTC) system was installed at Flakaliden in northern Sweden to examine the long-term physiological responses of field-grown 40-year-old Norway spruce trees [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] to climate change. The WTCs were designed as large cuvettes to allow the net tree-level CO(2) and water fluxes to be measured on a continuous basis. A total of 12 WTCs were used to impose combinations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, [CO(2)], and air temperature treatments. The air inside the ambient and elevated [CO(2)] WTCs was maintained at 365 and 700 micromol mol(-1), respectively. The air temperature inside the ambient temperature WTCs tracked air temperature outside the WTCs. Elevated temperatures were altered on a monthly time-step and ranged between +2.8 and +5.6 degrees C above ambient temperature. The system allowed continuous, long-term measurement of whole-tree photosynthesis, night-time respiration and transpiration. The performance of the WTCs was assessed using winter and spring data sets. The ability of the WTC system to measure tree-level physiological responses is demonstrated. All WTCs displayed a high level of control over tracking of air temperatures. The set target of 365 micromol mol(-1) in the ambient [CO(2)] chambers was too low to be maintained during winter because of tree dormancy and the high natural increase in [CO(2)] over winter at high latitudes such as the Flakaliden site. Accurate control over [CO(2)] in the ambient [CO(2)] chambers was restored during the spring and the system maintained the elevated [CO(2)] target of 700 micromol mol(-1) for both measurement periods. Air water vapour deficit (VPD) was accurately tracked in ambient temperature WTCs. However, as water vapour pressure in all 12 WTCs was maintained at the level of non-chambered (reference) air, VPD of elevated temperature WTCs was increased.},

@article{Berthrong2009,
abstract = {Afforestation, the conversion of non-forested lands to forest plantations, can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the rapid growth and harvesting of biomass may deplete nutrients and degrade soils if managed improperly. The goal of this study is to evaluate how afforestation affects mineral soil quality, including pH, sodium, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, and nitrogen, and to examine the magnitude of these changes regionally where afforestation rates are high. We also examine potential mechanisms to reduce the impacts of afforestation on soils and to maintain long-term productivity. Across diverse plantation types (153 sites) to a depth of 30 cm of mineral soil, we observed significant decreases in nutrient cations (Ca, K, Mg), increases in sodium (Na), or both with afforestation. Across the data set, afforestation reduced soil concentrations of the macronutrient Ca by 29\% on average (P < 0.05). Afforestation by Pinus alone decreased soil K by 23\% (P < 0.05). Overall, plantations of all genera also led to a mean 71\% increase of soil Na (P < 0.05). Mean pH decreased 0.3 units (P < 0.05) with afforestation. Afforestation caused a 6.7\% and 15\% (P < 0.05) decrease in soil C and N content respectively, though the effect was driven principally by Pinus plantations (15\% and 20\% decrease, P < 0.05). Carbon to nitrogen ratios in soils under plantations were 5.7-11.6\% higher (P < 0.05). In several regions with high rates of afforestation, cumulative losses of N, Ca, and Mg are likely in the range of tens of millions of metric tons. The decreases indicate that trees take up considerable amounts of nutrients from soils; harvesting this biomass repeatedly could impair long-term soil fertility and productivity in some locations. Based on this study and a review of other literature, we suggest that proper site preparation and sustainable harvest practices, such as avoiding the removal or burning of harvest residue, could minimize the impact of afforestation on soils. These sustainable practices would in turn slow soil compaction, erosion, and organic matter loss, maintaining soil fertility to the greatest extent possible.},

Several methods have been developed to study fine roots but they are either destructive or cumbersome, or may not be suitable for studies of fine root functionality. Electrical impedance, resistance, and capacitance have been proposed as possible non-destructive measures for studying roots. Their use is limited by a lack of knowledge concerning the electrical circuit of the system. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for hydroponically raised willows (Salix schwerinii) to estimate the root system size. The impedance spectra were investigated in three experimental set-ups and the corresponding appropriate lumped models were formulated. The fit of the proposed lumped models with the measured impedance spectra data was good. The model parameters were correlated with the contact area of the roots and/or stems raised in the hydroponic solution. The EIS method proved a useful non-destructive method for assessing root surface area. This work may be considered to be a new methodological contribution to understanding root systems and their functions in a non-destructive manner.},

Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide production through nitrification was simulated following the 'hole-in-the-pipe' model (4: M.K. Firestone et al. Microbiological basis of NO and N2O production and consumption in soil), N-gas production by denitrification was described with first-order kinetics. The model has been evaluated in a triplicate laboratory experiment, which involved three treatments (glycine, , or -pool labeled) to distinguish the different sources of N2O and NO. Heterotrophic nitrification was negligible, whereas autotrophic nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously in soils. Nitrification was the main source of NO and N2O in the black earth soil by field capacity (water content: 0.22 g H2O g(-1) soil). The NO release was higher than the N2O release, the N2O/NO ratio was 0.05 in this soil.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was applied to analyze proteins isolated from dissolved organic matter (DOM). The focal question was to identify the type and biological origin of proteins in DOM, and to describe diversity of protein origin at the level of higher taxonomic units, as well as to detect extracellular enzymes possibly important in the carbon cycle. Identified proteins were classified according to their phylogenetic origin and metabolic function using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein and taxonomy database. Seventy-eight percent of the proteins in DOM from the lake but less than 50\% in forest soil DOM originated from bacteria. In a deciduous forest, the number of identified proteins decreased from 75 to 28 with increasing soil depth and decreasing total soil organic carbon content. The number of identified proteins and taxonomic groups was 50\% higher in winter than in summer. In spruce forest, number of proteins and taxonomic groups decreased by 50\% on a plot where trees had been girdled a year before and carbohydrate transport to roots was terminated. After girdling, proteins from four taxonomic groups remained as compared to nine taxonomic groups in healthy forest. Enzymes involved in degradation of organic matter were not identified in free soil DOM. However, cellulases and laccases were found among proteins extracted from soil particles, indicating that degradation of soil organic matter takes place in biofilms on particle surfaces. These results demonstrate a novel application of proteomics to obtain a "proteomic fingerprint" of presence and activity of organisms in an ecosystem.},

abstract = {The more individuals hypothesis (MIH) postulates that productivity increases species richness by increasing mean equilibrium population size, thereby reducing the probability of local extinction. We tested the MIH for invertebrates colonizing microcosms that simulated tree holes by manipulating productivity through additions of leaf or animal detritus and subsequently determining the relationships among richness, total abundance, abundance per species, and measures of productivity. We quantified productivity as the rate of microorganism protein synthesis, microorganism metabolic rate, nutrient ion concentration, and type and amount of detritus. Microcosms with animal detritus attracted more species, more individuals per species, and more total individuals than did microcosms with similar amounts of leaf detritus. Relationships between richness or abundance and productivity varied with date. Richness in June increased as a linear function of productivity, whereas the power function predicted by the MIH fit best in July. Abundance in June and July was best described by a power function of productivity, but the linear function predicted by the MIH fit best in September. Abundance per species was best described by a power function of productivity in June and July. Path analysis showed that the indirect effect of productivity through abundance on richness that is predicted by MIH was important in all months, and that direct links between productivity and richness were unnecessary. Our results support many of the predictions of the MIH, but they also suggest that the effects of abundance on richness may be more complex than expected.},

abstract = {A protocol to assess the potential release of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) by enzymatic hydrolysis of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) in waters (sediment porewater and sewage liquors in this study) under environmental conditions is presented. This protocol enables the quantification of different classes of DOP compounds using a variety of phosphatase enzymes, i.e., alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and phytase. All experiments were carried out within the pH range of most natural waters, i.e., at neutral (pH 7) or slightly alkaline pH (pH 9). Tri-sodium citrate and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used in the assays to prevent interferences due to adsorption processes in the presence of multivalent metallic cations and to minimize protein binding. Applying this protocol revealed that labile phosphate monoesters always represented the largest fraction of enzymatically hydrolyzed P in sewage liquors and sediment porewater. Total enzymatically hydrolyzable P (EHP) represented only 16\% of the TDP in the sediment porewater but up to 43\% in sewage liquors. Because most of the enzymes used in this study are likely to exist in aquatic ecosystems, the EHP fraction might represent a source of potentially bioavailable P of similar magnitude to DRP.},

abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

We use a null model analysis of 124 incidence matrices from microbial communities, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and algae, and we compare these results to previously published findings from a meta-analysis of almost 100 macroorganism data sets. We show that assemblages of microorganisms demonstrate nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence that are broadly similar to those found in assemblages of macroorganisms. These results suggest that some taxon co-occurrence patterns may be general characteristics of communities of organisms from all domains of life. We also find that co-occurrence in microbial communities does not vary among taxonomic groups or habitat types. However, we find that the degree of co-occurrence does vary among studies that use different methods to survey microbial communities. Finally, we discuss the potential effects of the undersampling of microbial communities on our results, as well as processes that may contribute to nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence in both macrobial and microbial communities such as competition, habitat filtering, historical effects, and neutral processes.},

@article{MacArthur1966a,
annote = {MacArthur and Pianka's paper together with the Emlen's one (The role of time and energy in food preference), both published in the same issue of Am. Nat. in1966, was the inception of the optimal foraging theory. One of the main predictions of their paper --diets contract when food is abundant and expand when it is scarce-- constitutes one of the major tenets of evolutionary ecology.

        
They developed a graphical model of animal feeding activities based on a trade-off between costs and benefits. Their theoretical predictions are the following: 1) when the prey are abundant, the predator spends all of its time pursuing, catching and eating the prey, so it will choose only those prey items with the highest profitability; and 2) when the prey are scarce, the predator spends all of its time searching, so it will eat every prey item it finds. Therefore, diets should be broad when prey are scarce (long search time) and narrow if prey are abundant (short search time).

        
They also explored the optimal use of patches of habitat in an analogous way as they studied the optimal number of prey in the diet of a predator within a patch. The situation is quite  different in a patchy environment: when the prey is abundant, the searching time between patches is not reduced, so predators with high ratio search/pursuit will not restrict their diets. When the patch size is variable, larger patches should be used in a more specialized way (predators will spend more time within the patches) than smaller patches because travel time between patches is lower.},

@article{Hutchinson1959,
annote = {In this paper Hutchinson observes two species of waterbugs living in the same pond in a cave at the Shrine of Saint Rosalia on Monte Pellegrino, Sicily, and asks, "Why are there so many kinds of animals?" Many important ecological and evolutionary concepts on the origins of biodiversity are discussed here, although some of them were introduced by others. Hutchinson extends the concept of ecological niche that he first presented as "an n-dimensional hypervolume where every point corresponds to a state of the environment which would permit a species to exist indefinitely", in a paper entitled "Concluding Remarks", in 1957 at a Cold Spring Harbor symposium.

        
The ecological implications revolve around the trophic relationships between species. He explored how much diversity can introduce a food chain in a community by estimating the fraction of energy passing through one link to the next in the chain; the limitations of the length of a food chain by the competence with other species as a consequence of the change in body size during the lifetime; and what determines the number of food chains in a community. Although all these questions are focused on food chains, Hutchinson already realized that "Biological communities do not consist of independent food chains, but of food webs, of such a kind that and individual at any level (corresponding to a link in a single chain) can use some but not all of the food provided by species in the levels below it".

        
Based on the work about community stability by MacArthur (Fluctuations of animal populations and a measure of community stability, 1955) and biological invasions by Elton (The ecology of invasions by animals and plants, 1958), he answered the original question: "We may therefore conclude that the reason why there are so many species of animals is at least partly because a complex trophic organization of a community is more stable than a simple one,..." This conclusion relies on the belief, at that time, that the number of links in a food web increased the stability of a community (MacArthur, 1955; see May, Stability and complexity in model ecosystems, 1973, to find the opposite result). In the assembly process of a community new species occupy the empty niches in the initial stages, and then the splitting of niches previously occupied by a single species allows the communities become more diverse.

        
Last, there are evolutionary implications derived from the hypothesis that communities with many species will have more probabilities to diversify because they have more "evolutionary opportunities" than communities with few species. Therefore, Hutchinson suggested that evolutionary rates depend on how complex is the community. This is a very early idea related to the current debate about whether or not there is a constant evolutionary rate.

@article{Gould1979a,
annote = {Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin criticized the adaptationist program, "based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent", that had dominated evolutionary thought during the last four decades. They argued that organisms must be analyzed as integrated wholes constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that become themselves more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs.

        
The adaptationist program proceeds first by breaking an organism into unitary traits and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. When interactions between parts are recognized and hence, an organism cannot optimize each part without imposing expenses of others, the notion of trade-off is introduced. Then, the adaptationist program breaks an organism into parts and tells adaptive stories as if trade-offs among competing well designed parts were the only constraint upon perfection for each trait.

        
They characterized the adaptationist program through four common styles of argument: i) "If one adaptive argument fails, try another. The failure of one adaptive explanation should always simply inspire a search for another of the same general form, rather than a consideration of alternatives to the proposition that each part is 'for' some specific purpose"; ii) "If one adaptive argument fails, assume that another must exist"; iii) "In the absence of a good adaptive argument in the first place, attribute failure to imperfect understanding of where an organism lives and what it does"; iv) "Emphasize immediate utility and exclude other attributes of form". They pointed out that "One must not confuse the fact that a structure is used in some way with the primary evolutionary reason for its existence and conformation".

        
The pluralistic spirit of Charles Darwin regarding the role of natural selection is emphasized when the authors cite his words in the last edition of the Origin: "I am convinced that natural selection has been the main, but not the exclusive means of modification".

        
They presented some alternatives to adaptation for explaining the form, function, and behavior: i) "No adaptation and no selection at all" (the role of genetic drift: how much genetic variation between populations of between species is, in fact, the result of natural selection as opposed to purely random factors); ii) "No adaptation and no selection on the part at issue: form of the part is a correlated consequence of selection directed elsewhere"; iii) "The decoupling of selection and adaptation" (selection without adaptation, and adaptation without selection); iv) "Adaptation and selection but no selective basis for differences among adaptations" (different adaptations as solutions to the same problem); v) "Adaptation and selection, but the adaptation is a secondary utilization of parts present for reasons of architecture, development or history". 

        
They concluded their paper saying: "Under the adaptationist programme, the great historic themes of developmental morphology and Bauplan were largely abandoned; for if selection can break any correlation and optimize parts separately, then an organism's integration counts for little. Too often, the adaptationist programme gave us an evolutionary biology of parts and genes, but not of organisms. It assumed that all transitions could occur step by step and underrated the importance of integrated developmental blocks and pervasive constraints of history and architecture. A pluralistic view could put organisms, with their recalcitrant, yet intelligible, complexity, back into the evolutionary theory".},

annote = {Stuart Kauffman is a theoretical biologist who has been thinking about genetic regulatory networks and their role in constraining evolution for over forty years, becoming a legendary figure in complex systems and one of its big thinkers. This paper is the first attempt to study simplified computer models of genetic regulatory networks. His model was called "Random Boolean Networks".  

        
A Random Boolean Network consists of a set of nodes ("genes") and directional links between the nodes ("gene A regulates gene B" is represented by node A linking to node B). Starting from a random initial state, and iterated over a series of time steps, the nodes in the Random Boolean Network change state in random ways for a while (at each time step each node can be in either state "on" or state "off"), and finally settle down to either a fixed point (all nodes' states remain fixed) or an oscillation (the state of the whole network oscillates with some small period). Kauffman found that the typical final behavior is determined by both the number of nodes in the network and each node's number of incoming links. 

        
Since the Random Boolean Network have a finite number of nodes N, there are only a finite number of possible global states 2\^{}N, so if the network is iterated for long enough it will repeat one of the global states it has already been in, and hence cycle through the next series of states until it repeats that global state again (see the excellent book by Melanie Mitchell entitled "Complexity: a guide tour", 2009). When the number of incoming links to each node is two, he estimated that the average number of different global states was approximately equal to the square root of the number of nodes. Each global state or attractor is a pattern over time of "gene expression". Kauffman proposed that an attractor in his network represents a cell type in an organism's body.

        
Kauffman's model predicted not only the number of cell types in humans (although incorrectly), but also cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell. His most important point about living systems is that natural selection is in principle not necessary to create a complex creature (an idea discussed at length in Kauffman's book, The origins of order, 1993). Once a network structure becomes sufficiently complex --that is, has a large number of nodes controlling other nodes-- complex and "self-organized" behavior will emerge. He wrote: "Most of the beautiful order seen in ontogeny is spontaneous, a natural expression of the stunning self-organization that abounds in very complex regulatory networks. We appear to have been profoundly wrong. Order, vas and generative, arises naturally" (Kauffman, At home in the universe, 1995).},

@article{Bock1965,
annote = {During the 19th century, the period of the contribution of classical comparative anatomy to evolutionary theory, very few scientists included functional aspects of structure in their studies. Walter J. Bock and Gerd von Wahlert strongly advocated for incorporating not only the anatomical structure but also the function, the interaction structure-function and the interactions with environmental factors.

        
According to them, biological adaptation has to be studied in the framework of morphology and function. "The form and the function of phenotypic features have usually been disassociated for one another in evolutionary studies. In reality these dimensions constitute the two inseparable component of biological features and must always be considered together [...] The question of whether the form or the function of a feature changes first in evolution must be restated because under our definitions, the function of a feature changes automatically with changes in its form".

        
They defined the faculty of a feature as: "what the feature is capable of doing in the life of the organism and is the unit that bears a relationship to the environment. The faculty is, therefore, the evolutionary unit the feature. Neither the form nor the function alone can be an adaptation or can comprise an evolutionary unit because natural selection cannot act upon just the form or the function of a feature". If a feature has different forms and functions it will have different faculties and hence will be controlled by a different set of selection forces and each would have a separate evolution. Therefore, "the feature cannot be perfectly adapted to all the selection forces acting upon it, but it must be a compromise between all these selection forces".

        
They also defined the "biological role" of a faculty as "the use of the faculty by the organism in the course of its life history". Therefore, "the number of different selection forces acting upon a faculty would depend upon the number of biological roles." They wrote: "Selection forces do not act directly upon the form or the function of a feature, but upon the faculty through its biological role. Thus, the interconnections between the organism and its environment it through a couple formed by the biological role and the selection force".

        
Their reflections about the niche concept are quiet interesting: "an empty niche cannot exist any more than can a hypothetical organism. No organism means no niche. That is so because the niche can only be defined with the presence of the organism". So they are about the target of selection: "Natural selection always acts upon the phenotype of the whole individual; it does not act directly upon the genotype nor does it act independently upon single feature".},

annote = {The modern synthesis of population genetics and evolutionary theory was carried out mainly by the contributions of Ronald A. Fisher, Sewall Wright, and John B. S. Haldane, who developed the mathematical theory and explored its ramifications in the 1930's. The models developed assume constant selective values (fitness). Nowadays, it has been demonstrated that these models do not always adequately represent biological reality because the selective values of particular phenotypes appear to change with their frequencies in the population. 

        
In the original models the phenotypic changes depend on both the amount of variation in a population and the intensity of selection. Fisher's formalized in this book this idea in what he described as "The fundamental theory of natural selection". It states that the rate of evolution of a character at any time is proportional to its additive genetic variance, which is the heritable component of a character's genetic basis. The constant of proportionality is the quantitative measure of the intensity of selection. Intuitively, Fisher's theorem implies that individual selection will tend to make a species better adapted to environmental conditions. That is, individual selection always leads to an increase in the average fitness of a population. 

        
Fisher's theorem is not true when there are density or frequency-dependence interactions, linkage among loci, or correlations among characters caused by pleitropic effects of genes. Fisher and Wright showed that frequency- and density-dependent selection at a single locus would cause the mean fitness of a randomly mating population to approach a local maximum. In studies of purely density-dependent selection, several workers have shown that total population size will be maximized as a function of allele frequency at an equilibrium. When there is frequency-dependent selection the situation is more complicated and it is not clear whether natural selection actually maximizes something.

        
In this paper Sewall Wright introduced the concept of "adaptive topography". The environmental conditions determine the actual shape of the surface, and the surface in turn determines the course of evolution of the phenotype. According to Fisher's theorem, evolution will proceed uphill on the surface and stop when a peak is reached. When conditions change, the adaptive surface changes, causing the species to evolve to a new peak. Sewall Wright, who had many disagreements with Fisher (see below), reviewed his book in "The genetical theory of natural selection: a review" (1930) and wrote that it was "certain to take rank as one of the major contributions to the theory of evolution".

        
Wright and Fisher views are different in relation to how environmental changes affect the adaptive topography. Fisher assumed that evolutionary changes follow environmental changes that alter the adaptive topography. Wright, in contrast, argued that evolutionary changes occurred when a species moved to another adaptive peak through the action of other forces, particularly genetic drift. Eldredge and Gould (1972) adopted the Wright view when proposed the punctuated equilibrium theory of evolution. In the punctuational theory, an entire species does not move from one adaptive peak to another (as Wright's says). Instead a species gives rise to a new species which might occupy another adaptive peak. The punctuationalists agree with Wright that individual selection may play a more conservative and less creative role in evolution than Darwin's and Fisher's views.},

@article{McNab1963,
abstract = {All animals are limited in the extent of their daily wanderings. This is notably true of mammals, for which many estimates of home range exist. It is obvious that the size of a mammal will greatly affect the maximumarea that can be covered and, therefore, will influence the size of the home range. But body size has another, independent influence: larger species must collect more energy to supply their requirements than small species. Generally, a large energy demand will necessitate a large area for food gathering, unless the food exists in superabundance. Many other considera- tions may also alter the size of the home range (Brown, 1962), but the ob- ject of this paper is to examine only the relation between the size of home range and body size, since body size would appear at first glance to be the most important factor in the determinationof home range size.},
annote = {Brian K. McNab wrote this paper in 1963 as a first attempt to quantify the relationship between home range area and body size in mammals, bringing the concept of scaling (i.e., the correlation of quantitative data on an animal with its body size) to ecology. 

        
He showed that the home range of a mammal is proportional to the species' body mass raised to a power b, and that this relation was parallel to that found between the basal rate of metabolism and body size (for which the power b is 0.75). Much of the residual variation in home range size around the mean curve fitted to mass was associated with food habits: home range was large in species that are carnivores and seedeaters ("hunters") and small in species that graze or browse ("croppers"). Therefore, rate of energy expenditure and the ecological factors influencing energy availability have a significant impact on home range size in mammals.

        
McNab concluded that the size of the home range "is determined, mainly, by the amount of energy expended by the species". However, a causal relationship cannot be established from this study. As the author himself said to "This week's citation classic" (Current Contents, 1989): "Aside from the technical question whether the original analysis was, or was not, in some sense "correct", the ideas contained in this paper helped to bring to the attention of ecologists that many aspects of the physiology and ecology of animals can be described as a power function of body mass and that body size is one of the most important characteristics of an animal, an idea that gains prominence with the passage of time".},

@incollection{Zuckerkandl1962a,
address = {New York},
annote = {Emile Zuckerkandl and his postdoctoral advisor at Caltech Linus Pauling proposed in 1962 the evolutionary theory of the molecular clock. They used a technique (fingerprinting) to create patterns of the amino acid sequences in hemoglobin molecules of several species. They showed that the number of amino acid differences in those hemoglobin molecules between different lineages changes roughly linearly with time, as estimated from fossil evidence. 

        
They proposed that the comparative-fingerprint method could be used to estimate how long ago any two species deviated from a common ancestor. To do that, the molecular clock must be calibrated using the fossil record because the only thing it can say is that one time period is twice as long as another. Specifically, the authors reached the conclusion that one amino acid would be substituted every eleven to eighteen million years for any given species.

        
The high evolutionary rate estimated from hemoglobin and other proteins was key to develop the neutral theory of molecular evolution by Kimura in 1968. When it was first proposed, the molecular clock was intended to be consistent with natural selection at the molecular level, and only later became associated wih neutralism (Morgan,  "Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the molecular evolutionary clock", 1998). 

        
The evolutionary theory of the molecular clock assumes a constant rate of evolution over time and over different lineages. This assumption limits the application of molecular clock models, not only because of the largely-known fact that the rate of new mutations depends on the number of generations rather than the number of years, but also because of the recent discoveries made by the field of genomics: nucleotide substitution rates are strongly body size and temperature dependent (the heavier the body weight and the colder the body temperature, the slower the mutation rate), and very heterogeneous over the genome.

        
Despite all these limitations, the molecular clock has become the most useful tool for studying molecular evolution (for more details of its relevance, see: Morgan,  "Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the molecular evolutionary clock", 1998; Takahata, "Molecular clock: an anti-neo-darwinian legacy", 2007).},

@article{Brown1956a,
annote = {Brown and Wilson introduced the term "character displacement" to describe that species will evolve to avoid competition by using different resources. Their point was: if populations of closely related species are different where they occur together, species occurring apart in isolation do not have to be different. "Character displacement is the situation in which, when two species of animals overlap geographically, the differences between them are accentuated in the zone of sympatry and weakened or lost entirely in the parts of their ranges outside this zone. The characters involved in this dual divergence-convergence pattern may be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological". 

        
The idea that populations in sympatry and allopatry represent a natural experiment, allowing the conclusion that differences can be attributed to the presence or absence of the other species was questioned later. Other factors, like habitat differences can explain the pattern. If the habitats of the sympatric and allopatric species are sufficiently similar than the situation can be viewed as a natural experiment, then the question arises of why the species are ever allopatric (see Grant, Convergent and divergent character displacement, 1972). 

        
Slatkin (Models of coevolution: their use and abuse, 1983) reviewed the mathematical models in the study of ecological character displacement and he concluded that character displacement is not the inevitable outcome of competition between species. "Instead, it depends on the balance between two forces, the force of competition between species tending to displace the mean values of the character and the force from the edges of the resource distribution tending to drive the mean values together. The relative strengths of the forces depend on the assumptions of the model and not in an obvious way".

        
Grant (1972), Arthur (The evolutionary consequences of interspecific competition, 1982) and others suggested the following criteria for demonstrating the ocurrence of character displacement (see Schluter and McPhail, Ecological character displacement and speciation in sticklebacks, 1992): (1) chance should be ruled out as an explanation for the pattern; (2) the phenotypic differences between populations in sympatry and allopatry should have a genetic basis; (3) differences between sympatric species must have evolved in situ; (4) morphological differences should reflect differences in resource use; (5) sites in sympatry and allopatry should not differ greatly in food, climate, or other environmental features affecting the phenotype; and (6) resources are limiting and interspecific competition for these resources is a function of character similarity. 

        
Character displacement was viewed as an important force in structuring ecological communities. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the role of competition and character displacement in structuring communities was questioned and its importance greatly downgraded (Losos, Ecological character displacement and the study of adaptation, 2000).},

Eldredge and Gould (1972) adopted the Wright view when proposed the punctuated equilibrium theory of evolution. In the punctuational theory, an entire species does not move from one adaptive peak to another (as Wright's says). Instead a species gives rise to a new species which might occupy another adaptive peak. The punctuationalists agree with Wright that individual selection may play a more conservative and less creative role in evolution than Darwin's and Fisher's views.},

abstract = {It is suggested that local animal species diversity is related to the number of predators in the system and their efficiency in preventing single species from monopolizing some important, limiting, requisite. In the marine rocky intertidal this requisite usually is space. Where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing, or are experimentally removed, the systems become less diverse. On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10⚬ to 49⚬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores. Hence tropical, or other, ecosystems are more diverse, and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores.},
annote = {The term "keystone species" was first introduced by Robert T. Paine in 1966, when he was studying a community of organisms that inhabited the intertidal zone along Washington's Pacific coast. Paine found that one species, the carnivorous starfish Pisaster ochracceus, played a key role in maintaining the balance of all other species in the community. He observed that if Pisaster ochracceus was removed from the community, the populations of two mussel species within the community grew unchecked. Without a predator to control their numbers, the mussels soon took over the community and led to local extinctions of benthic invertebrates and algae, reducing greatly the community's diversity. Although the term was originally applied to a predator species, it has recently been extended to include also prey species.

        
Paine's hypothesis was stated as: "Local species diversity is directly related to the efficiency with which predators prevent the monopolization of the major environment requisites by one species". His conclusion: "Where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing, or are experimentally removed, the systems become less diverse", had important implications for the stability-complexity debate: "In the absence of a complicating factor (predation), there is a "winner" in the competition for space, and the local system tends toward simplicity. Predation [...] tends to increase local diversity".

        
The identification of keystone species has become a popular target in conservation efforts: protecting important species stabilizes an entire community. But the problem is how to define and quantify species "importance" in an ecosystem or community. Recent advances in network theory applied to the study of food webs, plant-animal mutualistic networks and host-parasite interactions, provide us insight about the structural and dynamic role of species in a community. Coextinction cascades and changes in species abundances caused by the removal of one species could be used as indicators of the importance of a species within a community. The identity of these keystone species could change within the same community depending on the structure of the network of interactions.},

@article{Shannon1948,
annote = {Claude E. Shannon developed the information theory in a long paper published in 1948. He introduced a measure of quantity of information: -sum(p\_i * log2(p\_i)). That is, the capacity of a channel to transmit information, given by the number of different messages that could have been sent. The theory was, in the early days, not concerned with meaning, but only with quantity of information: as Weaver put it: "this word 'information' in communication theory relates not so much to what you do say, as to what you could say" (Shannon and Weaver, "The mathematical theory of communication", 1949).

        
The average number of bits needed for storage or communication is the definition of entropy in statistical mechanics (by Boltzmann). Entropy quantifies the uncertainty involved in predicting the value of a random variable. A bit is a binary digit and has two possible values (0 or 1). Two bits can distinguish four items (00, 01, 10, and 11). Therefore, we can distinguish n items with log2(n) bits. If you use a fair coin, the two possible outcomes, heads and tails, occur with equal probability. Therefore each flip requires 1 bit of information to transmit. Specifying the outcome of a fair coin flip provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (six equally likely outcomes).

        
Ideas from information theory have been applied in ecology. The Shannon index is a way of characterizing the species diversity present in a given community based on the number of species present (species richness) and the distribution of the number of organisms per species (species evenness). The index is increased either by having additional unique species, or by having a greater species evenness.

        
In "The concept of information in biology" (2000), John Maynard Smith discussed how ideas drawn from information theory can be applied to evolutionary biology: 1) the DNA contains information that has been programmed by natural selection; 2) this information codes for the amino acids sequence of proteins; 3) DNA and proteins carry instructions, or a program, for the development of an organism; 4) natural selection of organisms alters the information in the genome; and 5) genomic information is "meaninful" in that it generates an organism able to survive in the environment in which selection has acted. How natural selection accumulates genetic information in the genome? How can we quantify the quantity of information stored in the genome?},

He developed a model that describes the following situation: the food is spatially distributed in patches, and the predator encounters prey randomly only within a patch but spends time in traveling between patches. The predator must decide when it will leave the patch it is currently in under the assumption that while the predator is in a patch its food intake rate for that patch decreases with time spent there.

        
The model predicts that "the predator should leave the patch it is presently in when the marginal capture rate in the patch drops to the average capture rate for the habitat". This rule has been known as the marginal value theorem.},

annote = {Ehrlich and Raven's paper was the first essay explicitly focused on coevolution. It's a detailed description, based on the compilation of an extensive body of information, of the antagonistic interactions between butterflies and the plants used as food by their larvae. They suggested that the elaboration of biochemical defenses by some plants and the adaptive responses of butterflies have played a major role in the evolutionary radiation and diversification of both groups. They wrote: "We hold that plants and phytophagous insects have evolved in part in response to one another". 

        
Although they coined the term coevolution, they didn't define it. Since then, there have been misleading uses of the term, as Daniel H. Janzen pointed out (When is it coevolution? Evolution, 1980). Most of these cases associate the term coevolution to interspecific interactions, such as predator-prey, host-parasite, and mutualism. Is important to keep in mind that interacting species can coevolve, but not necessarily.

        
Janzen's definition of coevolution is restricted to pair-wise interactions: "evolutionary change in a trait of the individuals in one population in response to a trait of the individuals of a second population, followed by an evolutionary response by the second population to the change in the first". When either of both populations in the above definition are represented by more than one species, Janzen refers to the process as "diffuse coevolution". A more general definition of coevolution is given by John N. Thompson: "reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species driven by natural selection" (The coevolutionary process, 1994).},

annote = {Daniel Simberloff and Edward Wilson tested experimentally the equilibrium theory of island biogeography introduced by MacArthur and Wilson in 1967 (The theory of island biodiversity). They sampled the artrophod faunas of six very small mangrove islands and estimated their abundances. After that, they defaunated the islands through methyl bromide fumigation. The recolonization process, mainly by aerial transport, was monitored for a year and what they found was in agreement with the predictions of the equilibrium theory of island biogreography: the number of species in each island returned approximately to the pretreatment equilibrium and there was a substantial change in composition from week to week indicating extinction.

        
After the publication of "The theory of island biogeography" many papers attempted to fill data on island communities into the equilibrium theory framework. This theory states that the number of species in an oceanic or habitat island is a dynamical equilibrium between the extinction of species already there and inmigration of new species. Before this study, there was little direct evidence that islands actually behave that way because most studies consisted on either natural and uncontrolled experiments, or demonstrations of a species-area relationship that was consistent with the equilibrium hypothesis but could be explained in other ways. There was little evidence of continuing inmigration and extinction. This was the first controlled experiment.

        
In their own words: "The colonization curves plus static observations on untreated islands indicate strongly that a dynamic equilibrium number of species exists for any island. We believe the curves are produced by colonization, involving little if any interaction, then a gradual decline as interaction becomes important, and finally, a lasting dynamical equilibrium. [...] Extinction of the earliest colonists is probably caused chiefly by such physical factors as drowning or lack of suitable breeding sites and less commonly by competition and predation".},

@article{VanValen1973,
annote = {The evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen introduced in this paper the Red Queen's Hypothesis to capture the idea that there is a constant arms race between coevolving antagonistic species. Its name is a reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's "Alice Through the Looking Glass", in which the chess board moves such that Alice must continue running just to stay in the same place: "Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place". Continuous development is needed for an evolutionary system just in order to maintain its fitness in relation to the systems it is coevolving with.

        
The focus of the paper was the statement of a "new evolutionary law", or "the law of extinction". Based on the study of different extinct and living taxa, he stated that the length of a species' existence says nothing about its chances of dying off. He defined this law as: "the effective environment of the members of any homogeneous group of organisms deteriorates at a stochastically constant rate". In this formulation, the "effective environment of any organism is its adaptive zone plus the effects of any other organisms within that adaptive zone". He also defined it as: "the extinction in any adaptive zone occurs at a stochastically constant rate".

        
Some of the irregularities in this trend were explained using the results of MacArthur and Wilson work (The theory of island biogeography, 1967). That is, "the extinction rate depends on the area inhabited by the taxa: species and higher taxa occupying smaller areas have an expected rate of extinction greater than that of more widespread taxa". Another explanation was that genera or families with fewer species have a higher probability of extinction because the more diversified the taxonomic group the higher the probability of survival of the entire group.

        
He stated: "The Red Queen's Hypothesis is a sufficient explanation of the law of extinction but not one that is yet derivable with confidence from lower-level knowledge of the causes of individual extinctions and the nature of species interactions". He also envisioned "an adaptive landscape in a resource space", in which the amount of resources is fixed and "if one peak is diminished there must be an equal total increase elsewhere, in one related peak or more uniformly. Similarly, increase in a peak results in an equal decrease elsewhere". This landscape changes continuously because "species displace each other from areas of the adaptive surface", and because the distribution of resources within the landscape changes.

        
Van Valen realized the importance of game theory in undertanding the evolutionary process: "Which adversary is most important for a species may vary from time to time, and for some or even most species no one adversary may ever be paramount. Furthermore, no species can ever win, and new adversaries grinningly replace the losers. This is the direction of generalization of game theory which I think has not been explored". Note the relevance of his words in the last paragraph: "From this overlook we see dynamic equilibria on an immense scale, determining much of the course of evolution by their self-perpetuating fluctuations. This is a novel way of looking at the world, one with which I am not yet comfortable. But I have not yet found evidence against it, and it does make visible new paths and it may even approach reality".},

@article{Maynard-Smith1973a,
annote = {The logic of animal conflict (I) In this seminal paper John Maynard-Smith and George R. Price introduced the concept of "evolutionarily stable strategy" or ESS. An ESS is defined as "a strategy such that, if most of the members of a population adopt it, there is no mutant strategy that would give higher reproductive fitness". It was the first application of classical game theory to the study of evolution, a reseach line known as "evolutionary game theory", developed in more detail by Maynard-Smith in his book entitled "Evolution and the theory of games" (1982). The idea of ESS was developed independently of the Nash equilibrium developed by Jonh Forbes Nash (Equilibrium points in n-person games, 1950) that it is embedded within the ESS concept.

        
The logic of animal conflict (II) Group selection was the conventional explanation for the absence of serious injuries during a conflict between two animals with offensive weapons: if no ritualized tactics existed, many individuals would be injured, and this would mitigate against the survival of the species. They showed that group selection cannot by itself account for the anatomical and behavioral adaptations for the attenuated conflicts found in so many species. By using the mathematical notation borrowed from classical game theory they found individual selection, strategies advantageous for individuals. 

        
The logic of animal conflict (III) Selection would favor a strategy "hawk", characterized because the individual always continues the contest until he is seriously injured or his opponent retreats, when the payoff penalty for retreating uninjured is the same that for seriously injured.
That would correspond to a species where an individual fights only a single battle in its lifetime, on which its reproductive success entirely depends. The payoff in the evolutionary game is the change in fitness. When the payoff of retreating seriously injured is smaller than for uninjured, individual selection would strongly favor individuals who retreat. This situation represents a species where males have more than one opportunity to gain a mate. 

        
The logic of animal conflict (IV) They not only gave "an explanation of why, in a species with offensive weapons capable of inflicting serious injury, escalated fighting may be rare or absent", but also how "in a contest between opponents who are unable to inflict serious injury, victory goes to the one who is prepared to continue for a longer time". The explanation for the first case was in the framework of "pure strategies", while for the second was in the context of "mixed strategies". These mixed strategies imply either a distribution of different strategies between individuals in a polymorphic population or individuals whose behavior differ from contest to contest.

        
The logic of animal conflict (V) This work was the first step towards a theoretical framework for studying the phenotypic evolution. Thomas L. Vincent and Joel S. Brown have been developing the evolutionary game theory since then. In an early review of the changes that the ESS concept experimented (The evolution of the ESS theory, 1988) they nicely stated: "It is interesting to note, however, that Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection without knowledge of theoretical population genetics. Is evolution really a game? A game may be defined in terms of four components: rules, players, strategies, and payoffs. The rules of the game determine how the strategies chosen by each individual player affect the payoffs of all players. In an evolutionary game, the individual organisms are the players, their inheritable phenotypes are the strategies, and their fitnesses are the payoffs. The rules of the game are dictated by Nature." },

Pere Alberch, in collaboration with his two co-supervisors George Oster and David B. Wake, and Stephen Jay Gould, explored the phenomena known as heterochrony: changes in the timing of events leading to changes in size and shape during the ontogeny. According to the authors, the goal of the paper was "to show how the evolution of size and shape can be related to developmental, populational, and environmental phenomena in order to generate testable hypotheses relating to the interface of growth in individuals and populations".

        
They emphasized the importance of development in evolution through the concept of "ontogenetic trajectory". The size and shape of an organism can be represented by a collection of size and shape measurements that we can visualize as a point in "shape-size space". As an organism ages from its conception, the form coordinates trace out a trajectory in "age-size-shape space". That is its ontogenetic trajectory: "The ontogenetic trajectory is an idealization which refers to the growth of a single individual in a population. In principle, if enough size and shape coordinates are included, we can describe the ontogeny of an entire individual. In practice, however, we can only trace one, or a few, body parts at a time. A different individual, even an identical twin, will have to somewhat different trajectory, because a multitude of influences intervene during development. A population can be viewed as a "cloud" of points, each tracing its own ontogenetic trajectory".

        
The ontogenetic trajectory generated by the growth law is completely defined by i) the age of onset of growth, ii) the growth rate, and iii) the rate of change in shape. A perturbation whose only effect is to increase or decrease the size growth rate will produce an adult descendant with the same shape but of larger size (proportioned giantism) or smaller size (proportioned dwarfism), respectively. A perturbation causing positive or negative changes in the rate of change in shape will produce phenotypes which either have a morphology like a juvenile ancestor (neoteny) or transcend the ancestor form (a process called acceleration), respectively.

        
They also discussed the phenomenon of recapitulation in phylogeny formulated by Haeckel: the descendant's ontogenetic trajectory passes through a sequence of forms in the same order as the phylogenetic progression of adult forms. Haeckel's theory is currently rejected by the modern biology. What has been confirmed is that early embryonic stages are similar to the same embryonic stage of related species but not to the adult stages of these species.

        
Pere Alberch showed us during his life the importance of ontogenetic development in evolution: small mutations in ontogenetic parameters can cause a series of developmental alterations that produce discontinuous phenotypes qualitatively different from the normal one. They remarked that it is possible that the genetic capacity for producing ancestral structures was never lost during the phylogeny, but merely turned off: "Latent capacities for the generation of ancestral structures probably exist in the genomes of all specialized animals". His work added another dimension to the study of evolution. Until then, genetic evolution (facing epigenetics), and phenotypic evolution (dealing with static morphologies) were the two approaches dominating the field. Ontogenetic trajectories and their links with development are also needed if we aim to understand evolutionary biology.},

annote = {In the first half of the past century, empirical studies pointed out the importance of genetic changes as a cause of population fluctuations. But the incorporation of evolutionary dynamics in models of ecological dynamics has been largely ignored. David Pimentel was the first in trying to formalize mathematically the interaction between changes in gene frequency and changes in population size. In this paper he focused analytically on a plant-herbivore system in which prey evolution causes stable or oscillatory predator dynamics, whereas unstable outbreak dynamics is the outcome of the model without evolution.

        
Pimentel and colleagues published the first experimental evidence of evolutionary change directly influencing community dynamics in a series of experiments with houseflies and parasitoid wasps (Space-time structure of the environment and the survival of parasite-host systems, 1963). They demonstrate that evolution towards increased resistance in the host and towards reduced virulence in the parasitoid decisively influenced the community dynamics. Although the techniques for genetic characterization did not exist at the time, they showed that evolution can lead to a dynamical stabilization of a two-species community in laboratory populations.

        
Fussmann and collegues wrote a recent review of theoretical and empirical studies in which evolutionary processes significantly affect the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems (Eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities and ecosystems, 2007). They review instances where rapid evolutionary processes interact with population dynamics. "The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities." 

        
The study of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological processes has been broadened under the banner of community genetics (see Whitham et. al., Community and ecosystem genetics: a consequence of the extended phenotype, 2003; Neuhauser et. al., Community genetics: expanding the synthesis of ecology and genetics, 2003). The starting point is that changes in genotype frequency results in a change in the phenotypic traits that crucially affect interaction strength among populations, and therefore influence community dynamics.},

annote = {Paul K. Dayton's studies extended his advisor's paper (Paine, Food web complexity and species diversity, 1966) by demonstrating, using field experimentation, that different perturbations structure the intertidal community. This long paper was based on his Ph.D. dissertation, and I brought it to light because one of its major conclusions was that relatively few species have disproportionately important selective influences on most of the other species. That was the inception of the term "foundation species" introduced one year later (Dayton, Toward an understanding of community resilience and the potential effects of enrichments to the benthos at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, 1972).

        
Following Dayton (1972), a foundation species is "a single species that defines much of the structure of a community by creating locally stable conditions for other species, and by modulating and stabilizing fundamental ecosystem processes." The loss of foundation species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend and disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow (see Ellison et al., Loss of foundation species: consequences for the structure and dynamics of forested ecosystems, 2005).

        
Other definitions related to the concept of foundation species are: 1)) core species, that are locally abundant and regionally commmon (Hanski, Dynamics of regional distribution: the core and satellite species hypothesis, 1982); 2) dominant species, that competitively exclude subordinate species by garnering a disproportionate share of resources and contributing most to productivity (Grime, Dominant and subordinate components of plant communities: implications for succession, stability and diversity, 1984); 3) keystone predators, that preferentially consume dominant competitors and enhance local biodiversity by preventing exclusion of weaker competitors (Paine, Food web complexity and species diversity, 1996); 4) keystone species, (Holling's extended keystone hypothesis) that all terrestrial ecosystems are controlled and organized by small set of keystone species (Holling, Cross-scale morphology, geometry, and dynamics of ecosystems, 1982); 5) structural species, that create physical structures of environments, produce variability in physical conditions, provide resources, and create habitat for interstitial species (Huston, Biological diversity: the coexistence of species on changing landscapes, 1994); and 6) ecosystems engineers, that cause physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials and modulate availability of resources to other species (Jones et al., Organisms as ecosystems engineers, 1994).  

        
There has been considerable debate in the ecological literature about whether the requirements of single species should serve as the basis for defining conservation requirements. These single-based approaches use different definitions of species as a shorcut to monitor or solve conservation problems.

        
The most commonly used terms are: 1) umbrella species, whose requirements for persistence are believed to encapsulate those of a significant number of other species across a wide array of taxonomic groups and in functioning natural systems (Murphy \& Wilcox, Butterfly diversity in natural habitat fragments: a test of the validity of vertebrate-based management, 1986); 2) indicator species, that reflect the quality and changes in environmental conditions as well as aspects of community composition (Landres et al., Ecological uses of vertebrate indicator species: a critique, 1988); and 3) flagship species, charismatic large mammals and birds used as vehicles for conveying the entire issue of conservation to the public (Mittermeier, Primate diversity and the tropical forest, 1986). },

It was suggested that these genetic systems uncovered by present day genetic studies are the relics of ancient systems of balanced polymorphism, stemming from the time wheat, barley, and flax reproduced by outbreeding. It was further suggested that a state of dual balanced polymorphism was a necessary condition for the co-evolution of obligate parasites and their hosts.},
annote = {This paper describes the first mathematical model of coevolution. It was developed to explore the coevolutionary dynamics of polymorphism in plants and pathogens. Mode’s model opened the development of what has been called “gene-for-gene” models: any gene in the host for resistance acts if an only if there is a corresponding gene in the pathogen for avirulence.

        
In gene-for-gene models host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs that increase with the level of investment in defense or attack. In contrast, in matching-allele-models there is no differential cost in the expression of alternative alleles (see Agrawal \& Lively, “Infection genetics: gene-for-gene versus matching-alleles models an all points in between”, 2002). Such costs of resistance have long been an important part of the theory of why defense genes do not always become rapidly fixed within populations.

        
Mode ends up the paper suggesting that: “these genetic systems uncovered by present day genetic studies are the relics of ancient systems of balanced polymorphism and that a state of dual balanced polymorphism was a necessary condition for the co-evolution of obligate parasites and their hosts.”

        
Although it is usually thought that Ehrlich \& Raven coined the term coevolution (“Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution”, 1964), Charles Mode was very aware of what coevolution means: “The genetic system of the host and parasite, therefore, have very likely been established in response to two types of opposing selection pressures, namely, the selection pressure exerted on the host by the parasite, and the selection pressure exerted on the parasite by the host.”

        
After formulating the three basic questions that arise from the genetic system uncovered by previous work, Mode makes an interesting point that we should not forget when dealing with mathematical modeling: “These questions will be considered in turn, but first it is necessary to digress for a moment and discuss some biology of the organisms in question, since a biological understanding of the situation is essential to mathematical arguments that follow”.},

This data paper also introduced the notion of physiological control of temperature regulation in some species.

        
Brattstrom did an enormous work measuring body, air, soil, and water temperatures of thousands of reptiles mainly from North America. Combining those data with observations of how the animals behaved, he showed a physiological as well as behavioral control of body temperatures. He also went further when he suggested that the limits of thermal requirements of modern reptiles could indicate past climates (although he was aware of the rates and ranges of thermal acclimation).

annote = {As opposed to allopatric speciation (the evolution of geographically isolated populations into distinct species), the concept of sympatric speciation introduced by John Maynard-Smith does not require geographic isolation to occur. In this case, the speciation from a single ancestral species inhabiting the same geographic region occurs without any constraint to interbreeding (see also Maynard-Smith, Disruptive selection, polymorphism and sympatric speciation, 1962).

        
The idea can be explained by the exploitation of different niches. For example, if individuals laid their eggs and tend to look for mates on the type of niche they grew up in, females and males will end up mating with other individuals from the same niche. This means that gene flow between two subsets of the population that mate on two different niches is reduced. This niche preference could maintain a stable polymorphism and may be the first step toward sympatric speciation. 

        
Maynard-Smith summarized, at the end of the paper, the conditions for a stable polymorphism to exist: "It is shown that in a heterogeneous environment divided into two "niches", a stable polymorphism can exist between two alleles each conferring a selective advantage in one of the niches, even if adults form a single random mating population, provided: (1) the population size is separately regulated in the two niches, and (2) the selective advantages are large."

        
There was a strong controversy about the concept of sympatric speciation that still persists nowadays. Ernest Mayr completely rejected it. Maynard-Smith made this explicit at the beginning of the paper, citing one of Mayr's criticisms: "On would think that it should no longer be necessary to devote much time to this topic, but past experience permits one to predict that the issue will be raised again at regular intervals" (Mayr, Animal species and evolution, 1963).

abstract = {The commonly observed high diversity of trees in tropical rain forests and corals on tropical reefs is a nonequilibrium state which, if not disturbed further, will progress toward a low-diversity equilibrium community. This may not happen if gradual changes in climate favor different species. If equilibrium is reached, a lesser degree of diversity may be sustained by niche diversification or by a compensatory mortality that favors inferior competitors. However, tropical forests and reefs are subject to severe disturbances often enough that equilibrium may never be attained.},
annote = {Until the publication of this paper by Joseph H. Connell in 1978, the high diversity of tropical rain forests and coral reefs was assumed to be at equilibrium because of interspecific competition: each species occupies the habitat or resource on which it is the most effective competitor. However, in this work the author presented several different possible mechanisms that can produce or maintain high diversity in coral reefs or rain forests, and suggested the conditions under which each could apply. Connell questioned the usefulness of the application of equilibrium
theory to much of community ecology.

        
First, he explored how communities seldom or never reach an equilibrium state, and that high diversity is a consequence of continually changing conditions. And second, he discussed the opposing view that, once a community recovers from a severe perturbation, high diversity is maintained in the equilibrium state by various mechanisms. Connell proposed six hypothesis to explain how the local diversity is produced or maintained (or both) which fall in two general categories depending on whether species composition of communities is usually in a nonequilibrium state (1-3) or in an equilibrium state (4-6).

        
In the first category: 1) diversity is higher when disturbances are intermediate on the scales of frequency and intensity (the "intermediate disturbance" hypothesis); 2) species are approximately equal in ability to colonize, exclude invaders, and resist environmental changes. Local diversity depends only on the number of species available in the geographical area and the local population density (the "equal chance" hypothesis); and 3) gradual environmental changes, that alter the ranking of competitive abilities, occur at a rate high enough so that the process of competitive elimination is seldom if ever completed (the "gradual change" hypothesis).

        
In the second category: 4) at equilibrium each species is competitively superior in exploiting a particular subdivision of the habitat. Diversity is a function of the total range of habitats and of the degree of specialization of the species to parts of that range (the "niche diversification" hypothesis); 5) at equilibrium, each species uses interference mechanisms which cause it to win over some competitors but lose to others (the "circular networks" hypothesis); 6) mortality from causes unrelated to the competitive interaction falls heaviest on whichever species ranks highest in competitive ability (the "compensatory mortality" hypothesis).

        
As he recognized, these hypothesis are not mutually exclusive: "Thus, all six hypotheses may contribute to maintaining high diversity". The relative importance of each is what it is very different. His argument is that "the assemblages of those organisms which determine the basic physical structure of two tropical communities (rain forest trees and corals) conform more closely to the nonequilibrium model". He concluded that "the existence of high local diversity in the face of such overlap in resource requirements is a problem only if one assumes equilibrium conditions. Discard the assumption and the problem vanishes".},

Hubbs showed that natural hybrids were most likely to be found in: i) disturbed environments; ii) localities where one parental species had been introduced; iii) localities where one parental species was rare and the other abundant; and iv) areas of stress where heterosis would enhance abundance.

@incollection{Eldredge1972a,
annote = {Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the concept of "punctuated equilibria" as an alternative to the "phyletic gradualism". It's a new picture for interpreting the fossil evidence. Punctuated equibria is characterized by long periods of morphological stability alternated with rapid and episodic events of speciation in isolated subpopulations: "Speciation is a rare and difficult event". Eldredge and Gould extended this idea farther (see Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered, Paleobiology, 1977).

        
Since Darwin, new species can arise in only two ways: by the transformation of an entire population from one state to another (phyletic evolution) or by the splitting of the lineage (speciation). The transformation is a slow, progressive, evenly, and gradual process that involves entire large populations over all the ancestral species' geographic range. Darwin considered speciation largely as a sympatric process, proceeding slowly and gradually too. Eldredge and Gould called this process "phyletic gradualism". Under this approach paleontologists should find in the fossil record all the intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant. Therefore, the morphological discontinuities that they observe are due to imperfections in the fossil record.

        
Punctuated equlibria is based on allopatric speciation in small, peripherally isolated populations. It can explain many gaps in the fossil record because speciation occurs in an isolated area at the periphery of the ancestral species' geographic range by adaptation to local conditions and reproductive isolation. When the descendant species migrates from the peripherally isolated area in which it was developed into its ancestral range, it differs substantially from its ancestor. Therefore, what we observe in the fossil record is a morphological discontinuity: "This alternative picture merely represents the application to the fossil record of the dominant theory of speciation in modern evolutionary thought". Ernst Mayr already anticipated this hypothesis when he developed the concept of biological species.},

@article{Nei1975a,
annote = {The genetic variability of a population is generally measured in terms of average heterozygosity. When population size is suddenly reduced, the average heterozygosity per neutral locus is expected to decline. Nei et al. asked the following: how quickly is the original level of heterozygosity attained when population size increases again? They introduced a mathematical formula for describing the average heterozygosity when population size changes. 

        
They also studied, by simulation, the loss of alleles due to a bottleneck effect: "if the number of alleles per locus decreases after a population goes through a bottleneck, the adaptability of the population may be limited even if the average heterozygosity remains fairly high".

        
They showed that 1) "the amount of reduction in heterozygosity due to the bottleneck effect depends not only on the bottleneck size but also on the rate of population growth after going through the bottleneck"; and 2) "the loss of alleles largely depends on the bottleneck size". In relation to these results, they found that the number of alleles per locus is reduced more drastically than the average heterozygosity. "This difference occurs because a bottleneck eliminates very low frequency alleles, while the remaining alleles may exist in intermediate gene frequencies [...], contributing to heterozygosity considerably".

@article{Hamilton1964,
annote = {In 1964, biologist William Hamilton described a selective process in which individuals affect kin (kin selection), developed a novel modelling strategy for it (inclusive fitness) and derived a rule to explain it (Hamilton's rule): if the fitness benefits are great enough, then altruism is favored between relatives. With its many successes, the theory became a cornerstone for modern biology.

        
The relatedness originally defined by Hamilton consists in looking at the proportion of genes being transferred from parent to offspring and then infer the relatedness based on the probability that a particular gene that an individual possesses will be found in a relative by their common descend. This gene-level selection assumes that genes are the unit of selection. 

        
Eusocial animals, such as ants, wasps, and bees, form hierarchical social systems with reproductive queens and sterile workers, meaning many individuals take the evolutionary counterintuitive step of sacrificing their own reproduction to care for the offspring of others. The sex determining mechanism of most of these species is called haplodiploidy: fertilized eggs become females and unfertilized eggs males. Hence, males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are haploid. This means that sisters are actually more closely related to each other (r=0.75) than they are to their own offspring, with which their coefficient of relatedness is r=0.5. For four decades kin selection theory, based on the concept of inclusive fitness, has been the major explanation of the evolution of such behavior.

        
Mathematical biologists Martin A. Nowak and Corina E. Tarnita and evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson presented recently a controversial work in the journal Nature (The evolution of eusociality, 2010). Their modelling shows that natural selection alone can explain the evolution of eusocial behavior without the need for kin selection theory. Setting aside their arguments against inclusive fitness theory, based upon a misunderstanding of this important concept, the novelty of their paper is that it provides several mechanistic models that explore the conditions under which eusociality might evolve. 

        
Yet, it is necessary to clarify the two major concepts introduced by Hamilton nearly half a century ago. First, inclusive fitness refers to the combination of both direct fitness (i.e. the reproductive success of the individual) and indirect fitness (i.e. an individual controlling or manipulating other reproducers in proximity). Second, kin selection is a cooperative behavior in which an organism works to enhance the reproductive success of a relative. Therefore, it represents only a limited portion of inclusive fitness. More specifically, it is a subset of indirect fitness. },

@article{Margalef1963,
annote = {In this essay published in Am. Nat. in 1963, Ram\'{o}n Margalef, the greatest Spanish ecologist, pointed out many inspiring ideas about the organization of ecosystems, the historical process of the ecological succession ("simply the exchange of an excess available energy in the present, for a future increase of biomass"), and what he called the "maturity" of an ecosystem: He stated that the structure of a community is linked to its history. The term "maturity" was introduced to take into account the historical process of the ecological succession: "In general, we may speak of a more complex ecosystem as a more mature ecosystem".

        
The structure of an ecosystem can be characterized by considering its elements (individuals and species) and the relationships between them, but also considering matter (biomass) and energy, and their flows. Margalef emphasized the relation between structure and energy flow per unit biomass (primary production/total biomass): "More mature ecosystems, with a richer structure, have a lower primary production per unit biomass. [...] The rate of change [in the ratio primary production/total biomass] is always negative along succession". Maturity can hence be measured as species diversity (if we consider the elements of the ecosystems and their interactions) and as primary production per unit biomass (if we consider biomass and energy).

        
The food chain length was anticipated: "In ecosystems of higher maturity there is a more complete use of food, there is a greater proportion of animals, and energy cascades through a more considerable number of steps". He also connected these ideas with the information theory developed by Shannon in 1948 when he mention the higher efficiency in every relation within the ecosystem as the maturity of the ecosystem increases: "If these relations are considered as communication channels, less noise comes into them". Margalef summarized his ideas in this sentence: "An ecosystem that has a complex structure, rich in information, needs a lower amount of energy for maintaining such structure. [...] This seems to be one of the basic principles of ecology, probably recognized tacitly by most writers, although rarely put in an explicit way". 

        
He predicted dynamical changes in the structure of the ecological networks of interacting species that we studied today: "Any ecosystem not subjected to strong disturbances coming from outside, changes in a progressive and directional way. [...] Links between the elements of an ecosystem can be substituted by other links that work with a higher efficiency, requiring a change in the elements and often an increase in the number of elements and connections". He realized that the predictability of change with time had to be considered, and that more diverse ecosystems have, in general, more predictable future states". This is related with the capacity of an ecosystem to respond to fluctuations: "In a more stable environment, succession proceeds as maturity increases; now we have to expect rhythms that are more regular, more independent of environment and often endogenous. [...] Maturity is self-preserving".

        
Margalef also explored the flows of energy between ecosystems: "An active exploitation by the more mature system may prevent the progressive development of a coupled subsystem, keeping it in a state of low maturity". He compared such a coupling to what happens when a developed country exploits and impedes the economic progress of the undeveloped ones, that is, its maturity. And also to what we can observe in the border between a forest and a open land: "It is expected that there will be more animals in the forest getting food from grassland, than animals in the grassland getting food in the forest".

        
The concepts of r and K selection coined by MacArthur and Wilson (The theory of island biogeography, 1967) were also anticipated by Margalef: "In less mature ecosystems or in less mature trophic levels of any ecosystem, we expect species to be short-lived, easily dispersed, able to colonize with rapidity virgin areas, able to leave numerous offspring and, of course, characterized by high ratio energy flow/biomass. [...] "In more mature ecosystems or in more mature areas of their structure, the selected species are of rather long life, with limited but well protected offspring, and with more restricted possibilities of dispersion accompanied by isolation in small breeding units".},

@article{Hardin1968,
annote = {In a seminal paper, Garrett Hardin argued in 1968 that users of commons are caught in an inevitable process that leads to the destruction of the resources on which they depend. The "rational" user of a common makes demands on a resource until the expected benefits of his or her actions equal the expected costs. Because each user ignores costs imposed on others, individual decisions cumulate to a tragic overuse and the potential destruction of an open-access commons.

        
In England the classic example of the commons is the pasturage set aside for public use, and the "tragedy of the commons" to which Hardin refers was a tragedy of overgrazing and lack of care and fertilization which resulted in erosion and underproduction so destructive that there developed in the late 19th century an enclosure movement. Hardin applies this social institution to other environmental objects such as water, atmosphere, and living space.

        
The cause of this tragedy is exposed by a very simple mathematical model, utilizing the concept of utility drawn from economics. Allowing the utilities to range between a positive value of 1 and a negative value of 1, we may ask, as did the individual English herdsman, what is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd that grazes on the commons? His answer is that the positive utility is near 1 and the negative utility is only a fraction of minus 1 since the effects of overgrazing is shared by all the herdsmen. Adding together the component partial utilities, the herdsman concludes that it is rational for him to add another animal to his herd; then another, and so on. The tragedy to which Hardin refers develops because the same rational conclusion is reached by each and every herdsman sharing the commons.

        
To avoid the tragedy Hardin argued that solutions must be imposed on users by external authorities. Today, the conditions most likely to favor sustainable uses of common-pool resources are still under research. Some of the most difficult challenges concern the management of large-scale resources that depend on international cooperation, such as fresh water in international basins or large marine ecosystems (Ostrom et al., Revisiting the commons: local lessons, global challenges, 1999). Will voluntarism save the whales and keep the skies unpolluted? At the end of his paper Hardin argued: "The most important aspect of necessity that we must now recognize, is the necessity of abandoning the commons in breedings. No technical solution can rescue us from the misery of overpopulation. Freedom to breed will bring ruin to all".},

@article{kimura1968evolutionary,
annote = {In 1968 Motoo Kimura argued that most mutations in the genome of mammals are neutral, they have no effect on their phenotypes. By using the rate of aminoacids substitution from comparative studies of some proteins (one substitution in a polypeptide chain of 100 aminoacids every 28 million years), he calculated that, on average, one base pair is substituted in a population every two years. This very high rate of nucleotid substitution can only be tolerated by assuming that most mutations produced by nucleotid replacement are neutral or nearly neutral to natural selection. His proposal, controversial at the time, is known as the "neutral theory of molecular evolution" (see his book published in 1983 under the same title).

        
In the last paragraph of his paper he remarked: "Finally, if my chief conclusion is correct, and if the neutral or nearly neutral mutation is produced in each generation at a much higher rate than has been considered before, then we must recognize the great importance of random genetic drift due to finite population number in forming the genetic structure of biological populations". His theory attributes a large role to genetic drift acting on neutral alleles arising typically through mutations of a single nucleotid within the sequence of a gene. These new alleles may be lost or become more common and fixed in the population by the sampling process. This assertion initiated a vigorous debate regarding the relative importance of genetic drift compared with natural selection. But we shouldn't forget that Kimura claimed that genetic changes, not necessarily changes in phenotypes, are the ones mostly caused by genetic drift. 

        
Nowadays it seems clear that, at least at molecular level, neutrality is the rule rather than the exception. In order to study phenotypic evolution one could argue that neutral mutations can be ruled out. But doing that we would assume that the effect of a mutation on the phenotype is independent on the effect of the other genes in the genome. As Ernst Mayr said, natural selection acts on the genome as a whole rather than on a particular gene. The consequences of a mutation depend on the rest of the genome: the same mutation can be neutral for an individual with a given genome, and potentially adaptive for an individual with a different genome. This misconception of how genes work was responsible of the neutralist-selectionist controversy. 

        
The concept of neutral networks of genotypes inspired by John Maynard Smith (Natural selection and the concept of a protein space, 1970) and developed by Peter Schuster and collaborators (From sequences to shapes and back: a case study in RNA secondary structures, 1994) can help reconcile the tension. The assertion by Andreas Wagner: "Neutral mutations prepare the ground for later evolutionary innovation" (Neutralism and selectionism: a network-based reconciliation, 2008) points to the right direction. },

annote = {Ernst Mayr was one of the primary developers and advocates of the general concept of species. He proposed in 1942 a definition of the species, now commonly known as the biological species concept: "species are groups of actually of potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." Since then, many alternative species concepts have been proposed, like evolutionary, ecological, and phylogenetic, among others. 

        
The general species concept emphasized the correspondence of species with gene pools, and was well established during the Modern Synthesis through the writings of the great leaders of that movement, including Sewall Wright, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, and particularly Ernst Mayr (see Kevin de Queiroz, "Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species", PNAS, 2005).

        
According to Sewall Wright "[species are] groups within which all subdivisions interbreed sufficiently freely to form intergrading populations wherever they come in contact, but between which there is so little interbreeding that such populations are not found." Similarly, according to Theodosius Dobzhansky "The biological species is the largest and most inclusive Mendelian population" (a "Mendelian population is a reproductive community of sexual and crossfertilizing individuals which share in a common gene pool"). 

        
Other species definitions that describe species as lineages rather than as populations are consistent with the correspondence of species with gene pools, because a population extended through time can be considered a lineage or because a population is equivalent to  a instantaneous cross section of a lineage (following Kevin de Queiroz, 2005). According to George Gaylord Simpson "[a] species is a lineage (an ancestral-descendant sequence of populations) evolving separately from others and with its own unitary evolutionary role and tendencies." Similarly, according to Leigh Van Valen, "A species is a lineage (or a closely related set of lineages) which occupies an adaptive zone minimally different from that of any other lineage in its range and which evolves separately from all lineages outside its range."

        
All modern species concepts and definitions conform to this general species concept: a separately evolving gene pool. The problem is that each alternative species definition adopts a different property as a defining or necessary property of species. Mayr described a more restricted concept that uses the property of intrinsic reproductive isolation to facilitate taxonomic decisions.},

annote = {This paper is the second covering a series of experiments designed by the entomologist Carl B. Huffaker to "shed light on the fundamental nature of predator-prey interations" and to "stablish an ecosystem in which a predator and a prey species could continue living together so that the phenomena associated with their interactions could be studied in detail".

        
In 1934 G. Gause's experiments with Dinidium and Paramecium as predator and prey, respectively, showed the tendency toward extinction among predator-prey populations in the absence of immigration into the depopulated areas or without the existence of prey refuges restrictive to the predators (The struggle for existence, 1934). Huffaker's work expanded Gause's experiments introducing habitat heterogeneity. He suggested that in "a sufficiently natural environment" coexistence is possible without the Gause's conditions. By "a sufficiently natural environment" he meant a heterogeneous habitat.

        
He designed an experiment using oranges as food for a mite species (another mite species was used as a predator) and varying the spatial position and the amount of accessible orange peel by interspersing the oranges among waxed rubber balls (introducing patchiness). On a single orange, the predator invariably exterminated the prey and then itself by starvation. But as the complexity of the spatial scenario increased making "less likely the predators' contact with the prey at all positions at once" the coexistence was possible and the predator-prey interaction continued for three cycles of population fluctuation.

        
Understanding how spatial heterogeneity and the varying dispersal ability of each species affect long-term population dynamics, Huffaker's original motivation, is still an active field of research today. Recently, Ilkka Hanski has been awarded the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences 2011 "for his pioneering studies on how spatial variation affects the dynamics of animal and plant populations". Congratulations!

@article{Pianka1970b,
annote = {In this short paper, published in Am. Nat. in 1970, Eric R. Pianka reviewed the concepts of r and K selection in order to clarify them and recognize that they did not constitute a true dichotomy but rather merely represented endpoints of a spectrum, what he called "r-K selection continuum". Although he showed that most insects and annual plants are r-selected whereas vertebrates and perennials are comparatively more K-selected, he emphasized that an individual or a population position on the r-K continuum is always changing. 

        
The terms r and K selection ("K" refers to carrying capacity and "r" to the maximal intrinsic rate of natural increase) were coined by MacArthur and Wilson (The theory of island biogeography, 1967). However, as Pianka explained in the first paragraph, Dobzhansky (Evolution in the tropics, 1950) was the first in addressing this question proposing that natural selection acts in a different way in the tropics than in temperate zones: in constant environments lower fecundity and slower development could operate to increase competitive ability (density-dependent selection), whereas in unpredictable environments selection favors high fecundity and rapid development (selection is independent of population density).

        
These two kinds of selection are clearly not restricted to the tropics and temperate zones. We can visualize an r-K continuum, as Pianka explained: "The r-endpoint represents [...] a perfect ecologic vacuum, with no density effects and no competition. Under this situation, the optimal strategy is to put all possible matter and energy into reproduction, with the smallest practicable amount into each individual offspring, and to produce as many total progeny as possible. The K-endpoint [...] density effects are maximal and the environment is saturated with organisms. Competition is keen and the optimal strategy is to channel all available matter and energy into maintenance and the production of a few extremely fit offspring". As the ecological vacuum is filled, selection will shift a population from the r- toward the K-endpoint.

        
Pianka speculated with the importance of the lifespan in generating the dichotomy between insects and annual plants (r-selected) and vertebrate and perennials (K-selected): "To survive, any resident organism with a generation time greater than a year must be adapted to cope with the full range of physical and biotic conditions which prevail at a given locality. An organism which lives less than a year encounters only a portion of the total annual range of conditions [...] Because longer-lived larger organisms are better buffered from environmental vicissitudes, their population sizes do not vary as much as those of smaller, shorter-lived organisms. Furthermore, presumably their competitive relationships are also more predictable and constant. The attainment of a generation time exceeding a year may well be a threshold event in the evolutionary history of a population".},

@article{Birch1948a,
annote = {This was the first application of the statistic known as the intrinsic rate of natural increase to an insect population (the weevil Calandra oryzae). It was calculated from experimental data on the age schedule of births and deaths in controlled environments. The study was conducted under the objective of determining the most favorable environments for the storage of grain stockpiled in Australia during the World War II, and hence finding the environments less favorable for the multiplication of the insect pests of stored grain.

        
The measure was based on the demographic parameter developed by Lotka (Elements of physical biology, 1925) for human populations, and developed a few years after the first determination of the intrinsic rate of increase of an animal other than man made by Leslie \& Ranson (The mortality, fertility and rate of natural increase of the vole (Microtus agrestis) as observed in the laboratory, 1940) for the vole Microtus agrestis from age-specific rates of fecundity and mortality determined under laboratory conditions.

        
Birch defined the "intrinsic rate of natural increase" as "the rate of increase per head under specified physical conditions, in an unlimited environment where the effects of increasing density do not need to be considered". The growth of such a population is by definition exponential. This parameter is the "r" in the differential equation for population increase: dN/dt=rN, that is, the difference between the birth-rate and the death-rate in the population. It does not describe the actual rate of increase of a population at a particular point of time but the maximum rate that it can ever maintain over an indefinite period of time "in a population with a stable age distribution". 

        
The method used in the calculations provided a means of determining the extent to which various components enter into the value of the intrinsic rate of natural increase: 1) the life table: the probability at birth of being alive at age x; 2) the fecundity table: the mean number of female offspring produced in a unit of time by a female aged x; and 3) the length of the pre-reproductive stages. One of the results was that the intrinsic rate of natural increase of C. oryzae was determined to a much greater extent by the rate of egg-laying in the first two weeks of life than by the total number of eggs laid in the entire life of 30 weeks.},

The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia’s genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication. Daphnia-specific genes, including many additional loci within sequenced regions that are otherwise devoid of annotations, are the most responsive genes to ecological challenges.},

The key change is basing the assessments on mechanisms and toxicant modes of action. Identifying pathways of toxicity (PoT), especially on a larger scale, evidently requires omics technologies. When the PoT is known, a test battery allowing higher throughput than the current approach can be constructed. Here, we propose an extension of this concept to mapping the entirety of PoT in humans: the human toxome. Mapping the human toxome will allow us, for the first time, to conclusively identify substances as nontoxic or to identify nontoxic concentrations of substances (i.e., concentrations at which no relevant PoT are triggered). The concept is explained, and opportunities and obstacles are discussed, aiming to promote an initiative which will form the core of a Human Toxicology Project to implement Toxicology for the 21st Century.},

But the identity of an endogenous ligand activating the AHR under physiological conditions in the absence of environmental toxic chemicals is still unknown. Here we identify the tryptophan (Trp) catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) as an endogenous ligand of the human AHR that is constitutively generated by human tumour cells via tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), a liver- and neuron-derived Trp-degrading enzyme not yet implicated in cancer biology. TDO-derived Kyn suppresses antitumour immune responses and promotes tumour-cell survival and motility through the AHR in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. The TDO–AHR pathway is active in human brain tumours and is associated with malignant progression and poor survival. Because Kyn is produced during cancer progression and inflammation in the local microenvironment in amounts sufficient for activating the human AHR, these results provide evidence for a previously unidentified pathophysiological function of the AHR with profound implications for cancer and immune biology.},

abstract = {Physiological function emerges from complex biomolecular interactions (e.g., protein-protein) and control mechanisms that enable animals to respond and adapt to changes in their environment. Cell injury and pathology induced by pollutants and other stressors appears to involve the gradual and progressive dysfunction of complex biomolecular interactions, resulting in loss of integrated physiological interactions and homeostasis leading to a reduced capacity to respond effectively to stress. In order to determine whether complexity can be used as an indicator of health, the hypothesis that pathology involves a loss of biological complexity has been tested using a generic physiological interaction network. System complexity was evaluated using Eulerian cycles and connectedness (connectance\%) for estimating topological complexity and application of network theory (i.e., analysis of scale-free networks and network diameter). The complexity of the whole system increases when sub-systems, such as detoxication and anti-oxidant protective processes, augmented autophagy, protein degradation and induction of stress proteins, are up-regulated and start to interact significantly as part of a response to low-level stress (i.e., biphasic or hormetic response). However, with increasing severity of stress, cell injury and higher-level functional impairment lead to physiological dysfunction and breakdown of the whole interaction network with consequent loss of complexity. In summary for the model described here, network and graph theory appear to provide a mathematical formalism that can facilitate the system-level interpretation of health and dysfunction in living cells.},

abstract = {We provide a demonstration in humans of the principle of pharmacometabonomics by showing a clear connection between an individual's metabolic phenotype, in the form of a predose urinary metabolite profile, and the metabolic fate of a standard dose of the widely used analgesic acetaminophen. Predose and postdose urinary metabolite profiles were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The predose spectra were statistically analyzed in relation to drug metabolite excretion to detect predose biomarkers of drug fate and a human-gut microbiome cometabolite predictor was identified. Thus, we found that individuals having high predose urinary levels of p-cresol sulfate had low postdose urinary ratios of acetaminophen sulfate to acetaminophen glucuronide. We conclude that, in individuals with high bacterially mediated p-cresol generation, competitive O-sulfonation of p-cresol reduces the effective systemic capacity to sulfonate acetaminophen. Given that acetaminophen is such a widely used and seemingly well-understood drug, this finding provides a clear demonstration of the immense potential and power of the pharmacometabonomic approach. However, we expect many other sulfonation reactions to be similarly affected by competition with p-cresol and our finding also has important implications for certain diseases as well as for the variable responses induced by many different drugs and xenobiotics. We propose that assessing the effects of microbiome activity should be an integral part of pharmaceutical development and of personalized health care. Furthermore, we envisage that gut bacterial populations might be deliberately manipulated to improve drug efficacy and to reduce adverse drug reactions.},

The transfer of maternal glucocorticoids to offspring may be an inevitable cost associated with poor environmental conditions, or serve as a maternal effect that alters offspring phenotype in preparation for a stressful environment. Regardless, maternal glucocorticoids are likely to have both costs and benefits that are paid and collected over different developmental time periods. We manipulated yolk corticosterone (cort) in domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus) to examine the potential impacts of embryonic exposure to maternal stress on the juvenile stress response and cellular ageing. Here, we report that juveniles exposed to experimentally increased cort in ovo had a protracted decline in cort during the recovery phase of the stress response. All birds, regardless of treatment group, shifted to oxidative stress during an acute stress response. In addition, embryonic exposure to cort resulted in higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites and an over-representation of short telomeres compared with the control birds. In many species, individuals with higher levels of oxidative stress and shorter telomeres have the poorest survival prospects. Given this, long-term costs of glucocorticoid-induced phenotypes may include accelerated ageing and increased mortality},

abstract = {Arsenic toxicity is a global health problem affecting many millions of people. The main source of exposure is drinking water contaminated by natural geological sources. Current risk assessment is based on the recognized carcinogenicity of arsenic, but neurotoxic risks have been overlooked. In 1955, an outbreak of arsenic poisoning occurred among Japanese infants, with more than 100 deaths. The source was contaminated milk powder produced by the Morinaga company. Detailed accounts of the Morinaga dried milk poisoning were published in Japanese only, and an overview of this poisoning incident and its long-term consequences is therefore presented. From analyses available, the arsenic concentration in milk made from the Morinaga milk powder is calculated to be about 4-7 mg/L, corresponding to daily doses slightly above 500 microg/kg body weight. Lower exposures would result from using diluted milk. Clinical poisoning cases occurred after a few weeks of exposure, with a total dose of about 60 mg. This experience provides clear-cut evidence for hazard assessment of the developmental neurotoxicity. At the present time, more than 600 surviving victims, now in their 50s, have been reported to suffer from severe sequelae, such as mental retardation, neurological diseases, and other disabilities. Along with more recent epidemiological studies of children with environmental arsenic exposures, the data amply demonstrate the need to consider neurotoxicity as a key concern in risk assessment of inorganic arsenic exposure.},

abstract = {In this study, the antibacterial activity and chemical composition of Goniothalamus umbrosus leaves extracts were evaluated. The antibacterial activity was investigated using two gram-positive bacteria, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Bacillus subtilis B29, and two gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 60690 and Salmonella choleraesuis. The activity was tested using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays. The chemical compositions of the ethyl acetate extract of G. umbrosus were investigated using Shimadzu gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-17A) while the mass spectra of the compounds found in the extract was matched with the library. The results showed that the extracts demonstrated broad spectrum antibacterial effects against all tested bacteria. GC/MS analysis of ethyl acetate extract of G. umbrosus revealed the existence of 1-butyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol (46.84\%), benzaldehyde (4.42\%) and globulol (4.07\%). The results of this study offer a platform of using G. umbrosus as herbal alternative for the current synthetic antimicrobial agents.},

abstract = {Background: Chemicals having estrogenic activity (EA) reportedly cause many adverse health effects, especially at low (pM-nM) doses in fetal and juvenile mammals. Objectives: To determine whether commercially available plastic resins and products, including baby bottles and other products advertised as BPA-free, release chemicals having EA. Materials and Methods: We used a very sensitive, accurate, repeatable, roboticized MCF-7 cell proliferation assay to quantify the EA of chemicals leached into saline or ethanol extracts of many types of commercially available plastic materials, some exposed to common-use stresses (microwaving, UV radiation, and/or autoclaving). Results: Almost all commercially available plastic products we sampled, independent of the type of resin, product, or retail source, leached chemicals having reliably-detectable EA, including those advertised as BPA-free. In some cases, BPA-free products released chemicals having more EA than BPA-containing products. Conclusions: Many plastic products are mischaracterized as being EA-free if extracted with only one solvent and not exposed to common-use stresses. However, we can identify existing, or have developed, monomers, additives or processing agents that have no detectable EA and similar costs. Hence, our data suggest that EA-free plastic products exposed to common-use stresses and extracted by saline and ethanol solvents could be cost-effectively made on a commercial scale, and thereby eliminate a potential health risk posed by most currently-available plastic products that leach chemicals having EA into food products.},

These individual end-points were associated to fish assemblage characterisation. Responses of biotransformation enzymes, neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption biomarkers revealed contamination of investigated stream by a mixture of pollutants. Fish from sampled sites downstream of the industrial effluent exhibited also strong signs of endocrine disruption including vitellogenin induction, intersex and male-biased sex-ratio. These individual effects were associated to a decrease of density and a lack of sensitive fish species. This evidence supports the hypothesis that pharmaceutical compounds discharged in stream are involved in recorded endocrine disruption effects and fish population disturbances and threaten disappearance of resident fish species. Overall, this study gives argument for the utilisation of an effect-based monitoring approach to assess impacts of pharmaceutical manufacture discharges on wild fish populations.},

According to the most stringent definition, an animal 'model' would display exactly the same phenotype as seen in the relevant human disorder; however, this precise correspondence is often not present. In this Editorial, I propose the alternative, broader term 'tool' to describe a biological system that does not obviously (or precisely) recapitulate a human disorder, but that nonetheless provides useful insight into the etiology or treatment of that disorder. Applying the term 'tool' to biological systems used in disease-related studies will help to identify those systems that can most effectively address mechanisms underlying human disease. Conversely, differentiating 'models' from 'tools' will help to define more clearly the limitations of biological systems used in preclinical analyses.},

abstract = {This article outlines the changes and underlying rationale for modifications to the histopathological evaluation of the nervous system during toxicology and carcinogenesis studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). In the past, routine evaluation of the nervous system was mostly limited to three sections of brain, and occasionally the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Factors such as the increasing occurrence of human neurological diseases and associated economical cost burden, the role of unidentified environmental stressors in neurodegenerative disorders, multiple therapeutic drug-induced neuropathies noted in human clinical trials, and the exponential use of environmental chemicals with unknown neurotoxic potential necessitate a more extensive evaluation of the nervous system. The NTP has modified its protocol to include examination of key anatomic subsites related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Modifications include four additional sections of the brain. Increasing the number of brain sections permits examination of a greater number of specific anatomic subsites with unique vulnerability. In addition, the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, trigeminal ganglion, and intestinal autonomic ganglia will be evaluated as needed. It is expected that this modified approach will increase the sensitivity of detecting neurotoxicants and neurocarcinogens important in human neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders.},

It is strongly supported by observations of leukemias that bear specific chromosome translocations, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, in which a translocation activates the c-myc gene, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the Philadelphia chromosome causes production of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Although the SMT has been modified and extended to encompass tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic inheritance, and tumor progression through accumulation of further mutations, perhaps the strongest validation comes from the successful treatment of certain malignancies with drugs that directly target the product of the mutant gene.

abstract = {Mitochondrial compromise has been documented in infants born to women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) who received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy during pregnancy. To model these human exposures, we examined mitochondrial integrity at birth and 1 year in brain cortex and liver from offspring of retroviral-free Erythrocebus patas dams-administered human-equivalent NRTI doses for the last half (10 weeks) of gestation. Additional infants, followed for 1 year, were given the same drugs as their mothers for the first 6 weeks of life. Exposures included: no drug, Zidovudine (AZT), Lamivudine (3TC), AZT/3TC, AZT/Didanosine (ddI), and Stavudine (d4T)/3TC. In brain and liver, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activities (complexes I, II, and IV) showed minimal differences between unexposed and NRTI-exposed offspring at both times. Brain and liver mitochondria from most NRTI-exposed patas, both at birth and 1 year of age, contained significant (p < 0.05) morphological damage observed by electron microscopy (EM), based on scoring of coded photomicrographs. Brain and liver mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in NRTI-exposed patas were depleted significantly in the 3TC and d4T/3TC groups at birth and were depleted significantly (p < 0.05) at 1 year in all NRTI-exposed groups. In 1-year-old infants exposed in utero to NRTIs, mtDNA depletion was 28.8-51.8\% in brain and 37.4-56.5\% in liver. These investigations suggest that some NRTI-exposed human infants may sustain similar mitochondrial compromise in brain and liver and should be followed long term for cognitive integrity and liver function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The debate regarding DDT in malaria prevention and human health is polarized. It can be classified into three positions: anti-DDT, centrist-DDT, pro-DDT. OBJECTIVE: To arrive at a synthesis by matching a series of questions on the use of DDT as indoor residual spray (IRS) with literature and insights, and to identify options and opportunities. DISCUSSION: Overall, community health is significantly improved through all available malaria control measures, which includes IRS with DDT. Is DDT 'good'? Yes, as it has saved many lives. Is DDT safe as used in IRS? Recent publications have added to concern - an unqualified statement that DDT used in IRS is safe is therefore untenable. Are inhabitants and applicators exposed? Yes, and to high levels. Should DDT be used? The fact that DDT is 'good' because it saves lives, and 'not safe' because it has health and environmental consequences, raises ethical issues. The evidence of adverse human health effects due to DDT is mounting. However, under certain circumstances malaria control using DDT cannot yet be halted. Therefore, the continued use of DDT poses a paradox recognized by a centrist-DDT position. It is time now, at the very least, to invoke precaution. Precautionary actions could include use and exposure reduction. CONCLUSIONS: There are situations where DDT will provide the best achievable health benefit, but maintaining that DDT is safe ignores the cumulative indications of many studies. In such situations, addressing the paradox from a centrist-DDT position and invoking precaution will help design choices for a healthier life.},

A central goal of space toxicology is to protect the health of the astronaut by assessing potential chemical exposures during spaceflight and setting safe limits that will protect the astronaut against chemical exposures while in a physiologically altered state. In order to maintain sustained occupation in space on the International Space Station (ISS), toxicological risks must be assessed and managed within the context of isolation, continuous exposures, reuse of air and water, limited rescue options, and the need to use highly toxic compounds for propulsion and other purposes. As we begin to explore other celestial bodies, in situ toxicological risks, such as inhalation of reactive mineral dusts, must also be managed.},

abstract = {The objective of the RETHINK project was to evaluate the potential impact of toxicity testing in the minipig as an alternative approach in regulatory toxicity testing that can contribute to the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing (3Rs). Expert study groups (Working Groups) were assembled to review five different areas relating to the use of minipigs in regulatory safety testing: ethical issues, welfare and animal care, development of new medicines and chemicals, safety testing issues and emerging technologies in safety testing. The conclusions and recommendations of the projects are presented in this article. It is concluded that there are no specific areas where restrictions to the use of minipigs in toxicology are required for welfare reasons. The minipig model is generally acceptable to regulatory authorities, provided it is adequately justified. The minipig is an interesting model for safety testing since there are numerous anatomical, physiological, genetic and biochemical similarities to humans. In addition many features of the minipig make it a practical and flexible model for safety testing. The use of the minipig in development of products does not bring any financial penalty in terms of the cost of testing. Benefits in terms of 3Rs can be identified in terms of life-cycle analysis of the use of minipigs compared to dogs and non-human primates. Finally the minipig (unlike the dog) is well positioned to take advantage of genomics and gene manipulation technologies. Specific recommendations for further research are made, which could bring 3Rs benefits. To deploy the minipig to the best advantage, clear information is needed about the predictivity of the minipig for human toxicities, and focussed action to define the potential role of the minipig in testing of biologics.},

abstract = {Avian eggs contain substantial levels of various hormones of maternal origin and have recently received a lot of interest, mainly from behavioral ecologists. These studies strongly depend on the measurement of egg hormone levels, but the method of measuring these levels has received little attention. This paper describes the sampling, extraction, and assay of hormones in avian eggs and related methodological problems. The method of sampling is important because hormones are not homogeneously distributed within the egg, and after onset of embryonic development their levels may decrease and increase due to changes in egg structure and secretion or uptake of hormones by the embryo. The extraction of hormones from the yolk and chromatographic separation of different hormones for immunoassays can strongly influence the results because such procedures remove interfering substances such as proteins, lipids, and other hormones and their metabolites, which can cross-react with the antiserum used. Finally, the assay itself needs more validation than many studies report, especially with respect to the accuracy and specificity of the hormone measurements. We conclude that the addressed issues need more attention for the correct interpretation of differences in hormone levels within and between studies.},

However, the effects of PCBs on the development of tumor metastases are not fully understood.Objective: We evaluated the hypothesis that exposure to individual PCB congeners can facilitate the development of brain metastases in immunocompetent mice via the disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).Methods: C57/Bl6 mice were exposed to individual PCBs by oral gavage, and 48 hr later they were injected with luciferase-labeled K1735 M2 melanoma cells into the internal carotid artery. The development of metastatic nodules was monitored by bioluminescent imaging. In addition, we evaluated the functional permeability of the BBB by measuring permeability of sodium fluorescein across the brain microvessels. Expression and colocalization of tight junction (TJ) proteins were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy.Results: Oral administration of coplanar PCB126, mono-ortho-substituted PCB118, and non-coplanar PCB153 (each at 150 micromol/kg body weight) differentially altered expression of the TJ proteins claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 in brain capillaries. These alterations were associated with increased permeability of the BBB. Most importantly, exposure to individual PCB congeners enhanced the rate of formation and progression of brain metastases of luciferase-tagged melanoma cells.Conclusions: Our results show for the first time that exposure to individual PCBs can facilitate the formation of bloodborne metastases via alterations of the integrity of the brain capillary endothelium. Editor's SummaryPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) comprise a ubiquitous class of toxic substances associated with carcinogenic and tumor-promoting effects, as well as neurotoxic properties in the brain. However, the effects of PCBs on the development of tumor metastases are not fully understood. Seelbach et al. (p. 479) studied the ability of individual PCB congeners to promote brain metastases possibly by disrupting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Mice were exposed to individual PCBs by oral gavage and later injected with luciferase-labeled K1735 M2 melanoma cells into the internal carotid artery. The development of metastatic nodules was monitored by bioluminescent imaging. Blood-brain barrier function was evaluated by measuring permeability of sodium fluorescein across brain microvessels. Expression and colocalization of tight junction proteins were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. The authors found that coplanar PCB-126, mono-ortho-substituted PCB-118, and noncoplanar PCB-153 differentially altered expression of tight junction proteins claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 in brain capillaries. These alterations were associated with increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Exposure to individual PCB congeners also enhanced the rate of formation and progression of brain metastases of luciferase-tagged melanoma cells.

abstract = {Historically, toxicology has played an important role in verifying conclusions drawn on the basis of epidemiological findings. Agents that were suggested to have a role in human diseases have been tested in animals to firmly establish a causative link. Bacterial pathogens are perhaps the oldest examples, and tobacco smoke and lung cancer and asbestos and mesothelioma provide two more recent examples. With the advent of toxicity testing guidelines and protocols, toxicology took on a role that was intended to anticipate or predict potential adverse effects in humans, and epidemiology, in many cases, served a role in verifying or negating these toxicological predictions. The coupled role of epidemiology and toxicology in discerning human health effects by environmental agents is obvious, but there is currently no systematic and transparent way to bring the data and analysis of the two disciplines together in a way that provides a unified view on an adverse causal relationship between an agent and a disease. In working to advance the interaction between the fields of toxicology and epidemiology, we propose here a five-step "Epid-Tox" process that would focus on: 1) collection of all relevant studies, 2) assessment of their quality, 3) evaluation of the weight of evidence, 4) assignment of a scalable conclusion, and 5) placement on a causal relationship grid. The causal relationship grid provides a clear view of how epidemiological and toxicological data intersect, has the potential to permit straightforward conclusions with regard to a causal relationship between agent and effect, and can show how additional data can influence conclusions of causality.},

abstract = {1 Persistent pesticide residues remain a significant environmental pollutant, reducing breeding success of predatory birds even where such pesticides have been banned for many years. The ability to detect such residues inexpensively without destructive sampling would be a valuable tool for ecotoxicological monitoring. We suggest that assaying eggshell colour might provide such a tool. 2 Recent studies have revealed two mechanisms affecting eggshell pigmentation in, and believed to be specific to, passerine birds. In the great tit Parus major, reddish protoporphyrin speckles on their otherwise white eggs coincide precisely with thin shell and are related to calcium shortage. In the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, the intensity of the eggshell's blue-green ground-colour (pigment biliverdin) is related to the female's health (immunocompetence) at laying. We studied the effect of the insecticide DDT (notorious for reducing eggshell thickness in raptors by blocking calcium availability to the shell gland) on the eggshell pigmentation of Eurasian sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (Falconiformes), whose eggshells show both protoporphyrin spotting and a blue-green biliverdin-based ground colour. 3 Eggshells showing protoporphyrin spots as an internalized pigment layer also showed a strong correlation between DDE levels (DDT metabolite) and shell thickness. The shells were also significantly thinner at these spots. Eggshell thickness was uncorrelated with DDE levels in eggs that lacked such spotting. 4 The green-ness of the ground colour, related to biliverdin pigment, also increased with DDE levels but, unlike the protoporphyrins, this increase was independent of eggshell thickness. 5 We also noted that the colour of eggs collected before 1930 was consistent with the environmental absence of DDT. 6 Synthesis and applications. DDT occurrence in predatory birds indicates ecosystem-wide contamination. Correlation between eggshell colour and DDT concentration indicates that pigmentation might be used as a non-destructive assay for DDT (which is still in widespread use, particularly for combating malaria) in eggs. Further studies should allow our findings to be applied to other raptor species. Our results corroborate the associations of protoporphyrin pigmentation with shell thinning and biliverdin with female immunocompetence described for passerines, but their occurrence in a falconiform implies that these effects evolved long before the appearance of the order Passeriformes.},

@article{Kaminen-Ahola2010,
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that exposure to some nutritional supplements and chemicals in utero can affect the epigenome of the developing mouse embryo, resulting in adult disease. Our hypothesis is that epigenetics is also involved in the gestational programming of adult phenotype by alcohol. We have developed a model of gestational ethanol exposure in the mouse based on maternal ad libitum ingestion of 10\% (v/v) ethanol between gestational days 0.5-8.5 and observed changes in the expression of an epigenetically-sensitive allele, Agouti viable yellow (A(vy)), in the offspring. We found that exposure to ethanol increases the probability of transcriptional silencing at this locus, resulting in more mice with an agouti-colored coat. As expected, transcriptional silencing correlated with hypermethylation at A(vy). This demonstrates, for the first time, that ethanol can affect adult phenotype by altering the epigenotype of the early embryo. Interestingly, we also detected postnatal growth restriction and craniofacial dysmorphology reminiscent of fetal alcohol syndrome, in congenic a/a siblings of the A(vy) mice. These findings suggest that moderate ethanol exposure in utero is capable of inducing changes in the expression of genes other than A(vy), a conclusion supported by our genome-wide analysis of gene expression in these mice. In addition, offspring of female mice given free access to 10\% (v/v) ethanol for four days per week for ten weeks prior to conception also showed increased transcriptional silencing of the A(vy) allele. Our work raises the possibility of a role for epigenetics in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and it provides a mouse model that will be a useful resource in the continued efforts to understand the consequences of gestational alcohol exposure at the molecular level.},

abstract = {Mechanistic toxicology has evolved by relying, to a large extent, on methodologies that substitute or complement traditional animal tests. The biotechnology and informatics revolutions of the last decades have made such technologies broadly available and useful, but regulatory toxicology has been slow to embrace these new approaches. Major validation efforts, however, have delivered the evidence that new approaches do not lower safety standards and can be integrated into regulatory safety assessments. Particularly in the EU, political pressures, such as the REACH legislation and the 7th Amendment to the cosmetic legislation, have prompted the need of new approaches. In the US, the NRC vision report calling for a toxicology for the 21st century (and its most recent adaptation by EPA for their toxicity testing strategy) have initiated a debate about how to create a novel approach based on human cell cultures, lower species, high-throughput testing, and modeling. Lessons learned from the development, validation, and acceptance of alternative methods support the creation of a new approach based on identified toxicity pathways. Conceptual steering and an objective assessment of current practices by evidence-based toxicology (EBT) are required. EBT is modeled on evidence-based medicine, which has demonstrated that rigorous systematic reviews of current practices and meta-analyses of studies provide powerful tools to provide health care professionals and patients with the current best scientific evidence. Similarly, a portal for high-quality reviews of toxicological approaches and tools for the quantitative meta-analyses of data promise to serve as door opener for a new regulatory toxicology.},

@article{Weiss2010,
abstract = {Males and females of virtually all species differ in how they respond to their environment. Because such differences exist in almost all biological realms, including disease patterns and therapeutic outcomes, they have evoked calls by various bodies to incorporate their assessment in research. Neurobehavioral indices pose special questions because, unlike outwardly visible markers, they are described by complex functional outcomes or subtle alterations in brain structure. These divergent responses arise because they are inscribed in the genome itself and then by endocrine mechanisms that govern sexual differentiation of the brain during development and operate throughout life. Other organ systems that exhibit sex differences include the liver, an important consideration for neurotoxicology because it may process many toxic chemicals differentially in males and females. Despite the scope and pervasiveness of sex differences, however, they are disregarded by much of neurotoxicology research. Males predominate in behavioral experiments, few such experiments study both sexes, some investigators fail to even describe the sex of their subjects, and in vitro studies tend to wholly ignore sex, even for model systems aimed at neurological disorders that display marked sex differences. The public is acutely aware of sex differences in behavior, as attested by its appetite for books on the topic. It closely follows debates about the proportion of women in professions that feature science and mathematics. Neurotoxicology, especially in the domain of laboratory research, will be hindered in its ability to translate its findings into human health measures if it assigns sex differences to a minor role. It must also be sensitive to how such debates are framed. Often, the differences evoking the most discussion are subtle in scope. They do not lend themselves to the typical analyses conducted by experimenters; that is, reliance on mean differences and null hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {Many widespread and persistent organic pollutants, e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), causing it to translocate to the cell nucleus, where it transactivates target genes. AhR's ability to target the blood-brain barrier is essentially unexplored. We show here that exposing isolated rat brain capillaries to 0.05-0.5 nM TCDD roughly doubled transport activity and protein expression of P-glycoprotein, an ATP-driven drug efflux pump and a critical determinant of drug entry into the CNS. These effects were abolished by actinomycin D or cycloheximide or by the AhR antagonists resveratrol and $\alpha$-naphthoflavone. Brain capillaries from TCDD-dosed rats (1-5 $\mu$g/kg, i.p.) exhibited increased transport activity and protein expression of 3 xenobiotic efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, and breast cancer resistance polypeptide, as well as expression of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1, both AhR target genes. Consistent with increased P-glycoprotein expression in capillaries from TCDD-dosed rats, in situ brain perfusion indicated significantly reduced brain accumulation of verapamil, a P-glycoprotein substrate. These findings suggest a new paradigm for the field of environmental toxicology: toxicants acting through AhR to target xenobiotic efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier and thus reduce brain accumulation of CNS-acting therapeutic drugs.-Wang, X., Hawkins, B. T., Miller, D. S. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated up-regulation of ATP-driven xenobiotic efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of fetal origins of adult disease posits that early developmental exposures involve epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, that influence adult disease susceptibility. In utero or neonatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a high-production-volume chemical used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, is associated with higher body weight, increased breast and prostate cancer, and altered reproductive function. This study shows that maternal exposure to this endocrine-active compound shifted the coat color distribution of viable yellow agouti (Avy) mouse offspring toward yellow by decreasing CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) methylation in an intracisternal A particle retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene. CpG methylation also was decreased at another metastable locus, the CDK5 activator-binding protein (CabpIAP). DNA methylation at the Avy locus was similar in tissues from the three germ layers, providing evidence that epigenetic patterning during early stem cell development is sensitive to BPA exposure. Moreover, maternal dietary supplementation, with either methyl donors like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein, negated the DNA hypomethylating effect of BPA. Thus, we present compelling evidence that early developmental exposure to BPA can change offspring phenotype by stably altering the epigenome, an effect that can be counteracted by maternal dietary supplements.},

We measured serum unconjugated and conjugated BPA levels in adult female rhesus monkeys and mice following oral administration of BPA, and compared findings in mice and monkeys with prior published data in women. Methods: Eleven adult female rhesus macaques were fed 400 µg/kg deuterated BPA daily for seven days. Levels of serum dBPA were analyzed by isotope dilution LC-MS (0.2 ng/ml limit of detection) over 24 h on day 1 and 7. The same dose of BPA was fed to adult female CD-1 mice; other female mice were administered 3H-BPA from 2 to 100,000 µg/kg. Results: In monkeys the maximum serum unconjugated dBPA concentration of 4 ng/ml was reached at 1 h after feeding and declined to low levels by 24 h, with no significant bioaccumulation after 7 daily doses. Adult female mice and rhesus monkeys cleared serum unconjugated BPA at virtually identical rates. There was a linear relationship between administered dose and serum BPA in mice. Conclusions: BPA pharmacokinetics in women, female monkeys and mice is very similar. By comparison with \~{}2 ng/ml serum unconjugated BPA reported in multiple human studies, the average 24 h serum unconjugated BPA concentration of 0.5 ng/ml in both monkeys and mice following a 400-µg/kg oral dose suggests that total daily human exposure is via multiple routes and much higher than previously assumed.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Optimal ciclosporin A (CsA) exposure in kidney transplant recipients is difficult to attain because of variability in CsA pharmacokinetics. A better understanding of the variability in CsA exposure could be a good means of individualizing therapy. Specifically, genetic variability in genes involved in CsA metabolism could explain exposure differences. Therefore, this study is aimed at identifying a relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the variability in CsA exposure, while accounting for non-genetic sources of variability. METHODS: De novo kidney transplant patients (n = 33) were treated with CsA for 1 year and extensive blood sampling was performed on multiple occasions throughout the year. The effects of the non-genetic covariates hematocrit, serum albumin concentration, cholesterol, demographics (i.e., body weight), CsA dose interval, prednisolone dose and genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and PXR on CsA pharmacokinetics were studied using non-linear mixed effect modeling. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of CsA were described by a two-compartment disposition model with delayed absorption. Body weight was identified as the most important covariate and explained 35\% of the random inter-individual variability in CsA clearance. Moreover, concurrent prednisolone use at a dosage of 20 mg/day or higher was associated with a 22\% higher clearance of CsA, hence lower CsA exposure. In contrast, no considerable genotype effects (i.e., greater than 30-50\%) on CsA clearance were found for the selected genes. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the selected genetic markers explain variability in CsA exposure insufficiently to be of clinical relevance. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring is still required to optimize CsA exposure after administration of individualized doses based on body weight and, as this study suggests, co-administration of prednisolone.},

abstract = {Understanding relationships between the sequence and timing of brain developmental events across a given set of mammalian species can provide information about both neural development and evolution. Yet neurodevelopmental event timing data available from the published literature are incomplete, particularly for humans. Experimental documentation of unknown event timings requires considerable effort that can be expensive, time consuming, and for humans, often impossible. Application of suitable statistical models for translating neurodevelopmental event timings across mammalian species is essential. The present study implements an established statistical model and related functions as an open-source R package (ttime, translating time). The model incorporated into ttime allows predictions of unknown neurodevelopmental timings and explorations of phylogenetic relationships. The open-source package will enable transparency and reproducibility while minimizing redundancy. Sustainability and widespread dissemination will be guaranteed by the active CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) community. The package updates the web-service (Clancy et al. 2007b) www.translatingtime.net by permitting predictions based on curated event timing databases which may include species not yet incorporated in the current model. The R package can be integrated into complex workflows that use the event predictions in their analyses. The package ttime is publicly available and can be downloaded from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ttime/index.html .},

The goal is to ensure that studies are scientifically appropriate and necessary without being redundant, and that tests emphasize toxicological endpoints and exposure durations that are relevant for risk assessment. The ACSA Life Stages Task Force proposes a tiered approach to toxicity testing that assesses a compound's potential to cause adverse effects on reproduction, and that assesses the nature and severity of effects during development and adolescence, with consideration of the sensitivity of the elderly. While incorporating many features from current guideline studies, the proposed approach includes a novel rat reproduction and developmental study with enhanced endpoints and a rabbit development study. All available data, including toxicokinetics, ADME data, and systemic toxicity information, are considered in the design and interpretation of studies. Compared to existing testing strategies, the proposed approach uses fewer animals, provides information on the young animal, and includes an estimation of human exposure potential for making decisions about the extent of testing required.},

abstract = {There has been a growing concern that epigenetic events, that is, heritable changes in gene expression superimposed on DNA nucleotide sequences, may be involved in chemically and/or nutritionally mediated adverse health outcomes, such as reproductive toxicity and cancer. This concern has been driven by an increasing number of studies reporting toxicant-induced alterations to the epigenome in the form of changes in DNA methylation, histone/chromatin remodeling, and altered expression of non-coding RNAs. These three major mechanisms of epigenetic modifications may have coordinated, independent, or potentially antagonistic influences on gene expression. Complicating this understanding is the incomplete understanding of the normal state and dynamic variation of the epigenome, which differs widely between cells, tissues, developmental state, age, strain, and species. This review serves as a framework to outline characteristics composing an ideal epigenetic screen(s) for hazard identification in product safety assessment. In order to implement such a screen, first there needs to be a better understanding of adaptive versus adverse changes in the epigenome, which includes identification of robust and reproducible causal links between epigenetic changes and adverse apical end points, and second development of improved reporter assay tools to monitor such changes. An ideal screen would be in vitro-based, medium- to high-throughput, and assess all three branches of epigenome control (i.e. methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs), although also being quantitative, objective, portable (i.e. lab to lab), and relevant to humans.},

abstract = {In certain cases, quantitative tissue structural data derived from tissue sections may be required to make critical decisions in the drug development or risk assessment process. Most frequently, these questions center on test article-related effects on cell number. In this opinion article, the limitations of estimating cell number by standard cell or nuclear profile counts from sections/blocks collected for routine histopathology are discussed from both a scientific and regulatory perspective and contrasted with the robust, sensitive, statistically based methods of design-based stereology. Specific existing industry practices are reviewed. Recent advances in stereological theory, software, hardware, and automated immunohistochemical staining now make it feasible to implement unbiased stereological methods to assess test article-related effects on cell number in a regulatory toxicology setting. These design-based stereological methods for counting cells are recommended when the quantification of small changes in cell number is critical to the risk assessment or decision-making process. These methods provide levels of sensitivity and statistical guarantees of accuracy that no other currently available tissue section-based methodology can provide.},

abstract = {Exposure to environmental chemicals can have negative consequences for wildlife and even cause localized population extinctions. Resistance to chemical stress, however, can evolve and the mechanisms include desensitized target sites, reduced chemical uptake and increased metabolic detoxification and sequestration. Chemical resistance in wildlife populations can also arise independently of exposure and may be spread by gene flow between populations. Inbreeding-matings between closely related individuals-can have negative fitness consequences for natural populations, and there is evidence of inbreeding depression in many wildlife populations. In some cases, reduced fitness in inbred populations has been shown to be exacerbated under chemical stress. In chemical testing, both inbred and outbred laboratory animals are used and for human safety assessments, iso-genic strains (virtual clones) of mice and rats are often employed that reduce response variation, the number of animals used and associated costs. In contrast, for environmental risk assessment, strains of animals are often used that have been selectively bred to maintain heterozygosity, with the assumption that they are better able to predict adverse effects in wild, genetically variable, animals. This may not necessarily be the case however, as one outbred strain may not be representative of another or of a wild population. In this paper, we critically discuss relationships between genetic variation, inbreeding and chemical effects with the intention of seeking to support more effective chemical testing for the protection of wildlife.},

Such ‘unpalatability by appropriation’ is common in many invertebrate groups and also found in a few vertebrate groups. However, potentially lethal toxicity by acquisition has so far never been reported for a placental mammal. Here, we describe complex morphological structures and behaviours whereby the African crested rat, Lophiomys imhausi, acquires, dispenses and advertises deterrent toxin. Roots and bark of Acokanthera schimperi (Apocynaceae) trees are gnawed, masticated and slavered onto highly specialized hairs that wick up the compound, to be delivered whenever the animal is bitten or mouthed by a predator. The poison is a cardenolide, closely resembling ouabain, one of the active components in a traditional African arrow poison long celebrated for its power to kill elephants.},

Here we show that the problem of benefit-risk is to a considerable degree a problem of variability in drug response. We describe biological and behavioural sources of variability and how these contribute to the long-known efficacy-effectiveness gap. In this context, efficacy describes how a drug performs under conditions of clinical trials, whereas effectiveness describes how it performs under conditions of everyday clinical practice. We argue that a broad range of pre- and post-licensing technologies will need to be harnessed to bridge the efficacy-effectiveness gap. Successful approaches will not be limited to the current notion of pharmacogenomics-based personalized medicines, but will also entail the wider use of electronic health-care tools to improve drug prescribing and patient adherence.},

abstract = {Previous observations have demonstrated that embryonic exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin during gonadal sex determination promotes transgenerational adult onset disease such as male infertility, kidney disease, prostate disease, immune abnormalities and tumor development. The current study investigates genome-wide promoter DNA methylation alterations in the sperm of F3 generation rats whose F0 generation mother was exposed to vinclozolin. A methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with methyl-cytosine antibody followed by a promoter tilling microarray (MeDIP-Chip) procedure was used to identify 52 different regions with statistically significant altered methylation in the sperm promoter epigenome. Mass spectrometry bisulfite analysis was used to map the CpG DNA methylation and 16 differential DNA methylation regions were confirmed, while the remainder could not be analyzed due to bisulfite technical limitations. Analysis of these validated regions identified a consensus DNA sequence (motif) that associated with 75\% of the promoters. Interestingly, only 16.8\% of a random set of 125 promoters contained this motif. One candidate promoter (Fam111a) was found to be due to a copy number variation (CNV) and not a methylation change, suggesting initial alterations in the germline epigenome may promote genetic abnormalities such as induced CNV in later generations. This study identifies differential DNA methylation sites in promoter regions three generations after the initial exposure and identifies common genome features present in these regions. In addition to primary epimutations, a potential indirect genetic abnormality was identified, and both are postulated to be involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance observed. This study confirms that an environmental agent has the ability to induce epigenetic transgenerational changes in the sperm epigenome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: All forms of asbestos are now banned in 52 countries. Safer products have replaced many materials that once were made with it. Nonetheless, many countries still use, import, and export asbestos and asbestos-containing products, and in those that have banned other forms of asbestos, the so-called "controlled use" of chrysotile asbestos is often exempted from the ban. In fact, chrysotile has accounted for > 95\% of all the asbestos used globally. OBJECTIVE: We examined and evaluated the literature used to support the exemption of chrysotile asbestos from the ban and how its exemption reflects the political and economic influence of the asbestos mining and manufacturing industry. DISCUSSION: All forms of asbestos, including chrysotile, are proven human carcinogens. All forms cause malignant mesothelioma and lung and laryngeal cancers, and may cause ovarian, gastrointestinal, and other cancers. No exposure to asbestos is without risk. Illnesses and deaths from asbestos exposure are entirely preventable. CONCLUSIONS: All countries of the world have an obligation to their citizens to join in the international endeavor to ban the mining, manufacture, and use of all forms of asbestos. An international ban is urgently needed. There is no medical or scientific basis to exempt chrysotile from the worldwide ban of asbestos.},

What are the potential harms to minipigs relative to the harms for dogs and non-human primates and can these harms be reduced more easily in minipigs than in other species? Are there potential benefits resulting from the use of minipigs relative to dogs and non-human primates? In considering the answers to these questions, we present an ethical framework which was developed taking into account the viewpoint of all concerned parties. This ethical matrix provides a framework upon which to identify and explore issues raised by the moral imperative to seek a fair compromise between the differing needs of different interest groups, which includes both the moral agents and the moral patients. The moral agents are the different groups of human stakeholders including society at large, regulatory bodies, industrialists and animal care staff. The moral patients are the laboratory animals, both breeding stock held by the animal supplier, and experimental animals in laboratories. In considering these animals it cannot be assumed that dogs, monkeys and minipigs differ with regard to the pain and suffering that they may experience and undergo when treated in studies designed for safety assessment. On this basis we rejected the argument that minipigs are more acceptable experimental animals than dogs or monkeys despite the fact that their use may prove less offensive to some groups within society at large. Species selection must be made on a case-by-case basis where the benefits are assessed by weighing the scientific evidence relating to the predictivity of the animal model, against the harm that may accrue to the animals both from the test procedures and their lifetime experience within the laboratory environment.},

Because of the similarity in brain biochemistry, such pesticides may also be neurotoxic to humans. Concerns have been raised that the developing brain may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of neurotoxic pesticides. Current requirements for safety testing do not include developmental neurotoxicity. We therefore undertook a systematic evaluation of published evidence on neurotoxicity of pesticides in current use, with specific emphasis on risks during early development. Epidemiologic studies show associations with neurodevelopmental deficits, but mainly deal with mixed exposures to pesticides. Laboratory experimental studies using model compounds suggest that many pesticides currently used in Europe--including organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, ethylenebisdithiocarbamates, and chlorophenoxy herbicides--can cause neurodevelopmental toxicity. Adverse effects on brain development can be severe and irreversible. Prevention should therefore be a public health priority. The occurrence of residues in food and other types of human exposures should be prevented with regard to the pesticide groups that are known to be neurotoxic. For other substances, given their widespread use and the unique vulnerability of the developing brain, the general lack of data on developmental neurotoxicity calls for investment in targeted research. While awaiting more definite evidence, existing uncertainties should be considered in light of the need for precautionary action to protect brain development.},

Estimates of relative potency are used to rank chemicals by their effects, to calculate equivalent doses of test chemicals compared to a standard, and to weight contributions of constituent chemicals when evaluating mixtures. Typically relative potency is characterized by a constant dilution factor, even when non-similar dose-response curves indicate that constancy is inappropriate. Improperly regarding relative potency as constant may distort conclusions and potentially mislead investigators or policymakers. We consider a more general approach that allows relative potency to vary as a function of dose, response, or response quantile. Distinct functions can be defined, each generalizing different but equivalent descriptions of constant relative potency. When two chemicals have identical response limits, these functions all carry fundamentally equivalent information; otherwise, relative potency as a function of response quantile is distinct and embodies a modified definition of relative potency. Which definition is preferable depends on whether one views any differences in response limits as intrinsic to the chemicals or as extrinsic, arising from idiosyncrasies of data sources. We illustrate these ideas with constructed examples and real data. Relative potency functions offer a unified and principled description of relative potency for non-similar dose-response curves.},

Their causes are mostly unknown. A few industrial chemicals (eg, lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], arsenic, and toluene) are recognised causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and subclinical brain dysfunction. Exposure to these chemicals during early fetal development can cause brain injury at doses much lower than those aff ecting adult brain function. Recognition of these risks has led to evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in petrol. Although these prevention campaigns are highly successful, most were initiated only after substantial delays. Another 200 chemicals are known to cause clinical neurotoxic eff ects in adults. Despite an absence of systematic testing, many additional chemicals have been shown to be neurotoxic in laboratory models. The toxic eff ects of such chemicals in the developing human brain are not known and they are not regulated to protect children.

        Laura M Plunkett: Comment in Lancet
In asserting the existence of a “silent pandemic” of ￼developmental neurotoxicity,￼ P Grandjean and P J Landrigan (Dec 16, p 2167) P Grandjean and P Landrigan, Developmental neurotoxicity￼ of industrial chemicals, Lancet
        368 (2006), pp. 2167–2178. have apparently forgotten or ignored dose-response principles in their zeal to promote their opinions. In compiling their list of “chemicals known to be neurotoxic in man”, they derive much of their information from occupational exposure studies done when hygiene measures were much less stringent than they are now. Therefore, those results are of limited relevance to assessing general population risks, including those of sensitive populations (pregnant women, infants, children) in whom exposures are much lower. Grandjean and Landrigan's faulty logic is exemplified by ethanol. Abuse during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, a ￼developmental￼ syndrome with neurological manifestations. However, there are no data to show that maternal exposure to low, environmentally relevant levels of ethanol (ie, concentration in foods) places the fetus at any risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. Risk is a function of dose, even for ￼developmental neurotoxicity. With drugs, to see efficacy, a critical concentration at the target site is needed. The same principle applies to toxicity. Effects at high doses will not be realised at lower doses if the concentration falls below the target site threshold level. If Grandjean and Landrigan's logic is applied to drugs, an “outbreak of cures” would be predicted to be triggered by any dose of any therapeutic agent. Evidence-based medical practice would reject such a homoeopathic belief. Evidence-based toxicology and epidemiology dictates a similar conclusion with respect to Grandjean and Landrigan's allegations of a “pandemic” of ￼developmental neurotoxicity.

Reply from authors:
        
Laura Plunkett seems to have missed a main point of our review—ie, that during prenatal and early postnatal development the timing of exposure is at least as crucial as the dose. It is the unique sensitivity of the developing human brain during windows of early vulnerability that accounts for the profound damage caused by minute doses of lead, methylmercury, ethyl alcohol, and probably many other industrial chemicals that have never been properly tested. As we show with the few chemicals that are known to damage brain development, waiting for the production of detailed dose-response relations will promote the continued exposure of developing brains to toxic risks. Norman Saunders and Katarzyna Dziegielewska provide important information on the early development of the blood–brain barrier. Given that intercellular tight junctions between cerebral endothelial cells in the blood–brain barrier are already well developed from early embryonal life, any incomplete development of this barrier will have at most a partial role in the genesis of ￼developmental neurotoxicity.￼ The industrial chemicals that we identified as toxic to the adult brain are obviously capable of passing the mature blood–brain barrier. With regard to these substances, the risk of ￼developmental neurotoxicity￼ would not depend on any assumption of incomplete barrier development. PG has testified on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council in a court case in regard to mercury pollution from a chemical plant in Maine, USA. PJL has testified on behalf of the State of Rhode Island, USA, in a lawsuit against the manufacturers of lead-based paint.

        

        Saunders and Dziegielewska: comment
        
P Grandjean and P J Landrigan1 provide a valuable and timely review of industrial chemicals that are thought to have damaging effects if they reach the developing brain. In discussing possible mechanisms that might account for the vulnerability of the developing brain to these agents, Grandjean and Landrigan state “The blood–brain barrier is not completely formed until about 6 months after birth”, citing a paper by Adinolfi.2 This perpetuates the long-standing misconception that “the” blood–brain barrier in the fetus and newborn is immature.The term blood–brain barrier is used to describe a series of physiological mechanisms (inward and outward transport mechanisms) that control the composition and stability of the internal environment of the brain. Underlying these physiological mechanisms is the presence of intercellular tight junctions between cerebral endothelial cells (blood–brain barrier) and between choroid plexus epithelial cells (blood–CSF barrier). The presence of tight junctions is essential for the functional effectiveness of all the physiological barrier mechanisms. Tight junctions between cerebral endothelial and between choroid plexus epithelial cells have been known for decades to exclude the intercellular passage of proteins from blood into brain and CSF.3 The tight junctions at both blood–brain and blood–CSF interfaces are well formed from early embryonic life.4 However, there is a transcellular mechanism in a subpopulation of choroid plexus epithelial cells that transfers proteins from blood to CSF.5 This protein transfer mechanism might be relevant for the entry of some neurotoxic agents into the immature brain. For example, some of the heavy metals listed by Grandjean and Landrigan bind to proteins in plasma and could thus be transported into the brain via the choroid plexus. However, this is a reflection of a ￼developmental￼ specialisation rather than of immaturity.
We declare that we have no conflict of interest.},

abstract = {Continuing improvements in analytical technology along with an increased interest in performing comprehensive, quantitative metabolic profiling, is leading to increased interest pressures within the metabolomics community to develop centralized metabolite reference resources for certain clinically important biofluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid, urine and blood. As part of an ongoing effort to systematically characterize the human metabolome through the Human Metabolome Project, we have undertaken the task of characterizing the human serum metabolome. In doing so, we have combined targeted and non-targeted NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS methods with computer-aided literature mining to identify and quantify a comprehensive, if not absolutely complete, set of metabolites commonly detected and quantified (with today's technology) in the human serum metabolome. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage while critically assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of these platforms or technologies. Tables containing the complete set of 4229 confirmed and highly probable human serum compounds, their concentrations, related literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.serummetabolome.ca.},

abstract = {Cardiotoxicity, also referred to as drug-induced cardiac injury (DICI), is an issue associated with the use of some small-molecule kinase inhibitors and antibody based therapies targeting signalling pathways in cancer. Although these drugs have had a major impact on cancer patient survival, data has implicated kinase-targeting agents such as sunitinib, imatinib, trastuzumab and sorafenib in adversely affecting cardiac function in a subset of treated individuals. In many cases adverse cardiac events in the clinic were not anticipated based on pre-clinical safety evaluation of the molecule. In order to support the development of efficacious and safe kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and other indications, new pre-clinical approaches and screens are required to predict clinical cardiotoxicity. Laboratory investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms of heart toxicity induced by these molecules have identified potentially common themes including mitochondrial perturbation and modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Studies characterising cardiac-specific kinase knockout mouse models have developed our understanding of the homeostatic role of some of these signalling-mediators in the heart. Therefore, when considering kinases as potential future targets or when examining secondary pharmacological interactions of novel kinase inhibitors, these models may help to inform us of the potential adverse cardiac effects in the clinic.},

@article{dietert_perinatal_2006,
abstract = {Recent research has pointed to the developing immune system as a remarkably sensitive toxicologic target for environmental chemicals and drugs. In fact, the perinatal period before and just after birth is replete with dynamic immune changes, many of which do not occur in adults. These include not only the basic maturation and distribution of immune cell types and selection against autoreactive lymphocytes but also changes designed specifically to protect the pregnancy against immune-mediated miscarriage. The newborn is then faced with critical immune maturational adjustments to achieve an immune balance necessary to combat myriad childhood and later-life diseases. All these processes set the fetus and neonate completely apart from the adult regarding immunotoxicologic risk. Yet for decades, safety evaluation has relied almost exclusively upon exposure of the adult immune system to predict perinatal immune risk. Recent workshops and forums have suggested a benefit in employing alternative exposures that include exposure throughout early life stages. However, issues remain concerning when and where such applications might be required. In this review we discuss the reasons why immunotoxic assessment is important for current childhood diseases and why adult exposure assessment cannot predict the effect of xenobiotics on the developing immune system. It also provides examples of developmental immunotoxicants where age-based risk appears to differ. Finally, it stresses the need to replace adult exposure assessment for immune evaluation with protocols that can protect the developing immune system.},

abstract = {Agricultural pesticide poisoning is a major public health problem in the developing world, killing at least 250,000–370,000 people each year. Targeted pesticide restrictions in Sri Lanka over the last 20 years have reduced pesticide deaths by 50\% without decreasing agricultural output. However, regulatory decisions have thus far not been based on the human toxicity of formulated agricultural pesticides but on the surrogate of rat toxicity using pure unformulated pesticides. We aimed to determine the relative human toxicity of formulated agricultural pesticides to improve the effectiveness of regulatory policy. We examined the case fatality of different agricultural pesticides in a prospective cohort of patients presenting with pesticide self-poisoning to two clinical trial centers from April 2002 to November 2008. Identification of the pesticide ingested was based on history or positive identification of the container. A single pesticide was ingested by 9,302 patients. A specific pesticide was identified in 7,461 patients; 1,841 ingested an unknown pesticide. In a subset of 808 patients, the history of ingestion was confirmed by laboratory analysis in 95\% of patients. There was a large variation in case fatality between pesticides—from 0\% to 42\%. This marked variation in lethality was observed for compounds within the same chemical and/or WHO toxicity classification of pesticides and for those used for similar agricultural indications. The human data provided toxicity rankings for some pesticides that contrasted strongly with the WHO toxicity classification based on rat toxicity. Basing regulation on human toxicity will make pesticide poisoning less hazardous, preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths globally without compromising agricultural needs. Ongoing monitoring of patterns of use and clinical toxicity for new pesticides is needed to identify highly toxic pesticides in a timely manner.},

Frogs with extra limbs or digits, missing limbs or digits, or misaligned appendages raise an alarming question: "Are deformed humans next?" Taking a fresh look at this disturbing environmental problem, this reference provides a balanced overview of the science behind the malformed frog phenomenon. Bringing together data from ecology, parasitology, and other disciplines, Michael Lannoo considers the possible causes of these deformities, tells which frogs have been affected, and addresses questions about what these malformations might mean to human populations.

abstract = {It is widely believed that environmental standardization is the best way to guarantee reproducible results in animal experiments. However, mounting evidence indicates that even subtle differences in laboratory or test conditions can lead to conflicting test outcomes. Because experimental treatments may interact with environmental conditions, experiments conducted under highly standardized conditions may reveal local 'truths' with little external validity. We review this hypothesis here and present a proof of principle based on data from a multilaboratory study on behavioral differences between inbred mouse strains. Our findings suggest that environmental standardization is a cause of, rather than a cure for, poor reproducibility of experimental outcomes. Environmental standardization can contribute to spurious and conflicting findings in the literature and unnecessary animal use. This conclusion calls for research into practicable and effective ways of systematic environmental heterogenization to attenuate these scientific, economic and ethical costs.},

abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacture of plastics, and has been identified in various environmental matrices, including human serum and breast milk. The prevalence of BPA in the environment and the potential exposure to humans underscores the need to more fully understand the fate of BPA in the environment and the resulting effects and toxicity to humans and other organisms. Here we demonstrate that Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium vanbaalenii strain PYR-1, are able to O-methylate BPA to its mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives (BPA MME and BPA DME, respectively). The O-methylation of BPA results in metabolites with increased toxicity as shown from differences in survival and occurrence of developmental lesions in developing zebrafish embryos exposed to BPA, BPA MME, and BPA DME. The mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives were more toxic than BPA, resulting in increased mortality at 5 (LC(50) = 0.66 and 1.2 mg L(-1)) and 28 (LC(50) = 0.38, <0.5 mg L(-1)) days post fertilization. Furthermore, exposure to either of the O-methylated metabolites resulted in an increase in the incidence of developmental lesions as compared to BPA exposure. These data illustrate a new mechanism for microbial transformation of BPA, producing metabolites warranting further study to understand their prevalence and effects in the environment.},

Identifying these modifications via standard database searching can incur significant performance penalties. Here, we describe the latest developments in TagRecon, an algorithm that leverages inferred sequence tags to identify modified peptides in toxicoproteomic data sets. TagRecon identifies known modifications more effectively than the MyriMatch database search engine. TagRecon outperformed state of the art software in recognizing unanticipated modifications from LTQ, Orbitrap, and QTOF data sets. We developed user-friendly software for detecting persistent mass shifts from samples. We follow a three-step strategy for detecting unanticipated PTMs in samples. First, we identify the proteins present in the sample with a standard database search. Next, identified proteins are interrogated for unexpected PTMs with a sequence tag-based search. Finally, additional evidence is gathered for the detected mass shifts with a refinement search. Application of this technology on toxicoproteomic data sets revealed unintended cross-reactions between proteins and sample processing reagents. Twenty-five proteins in rat liver showed signs of oxidative stress when exposed to potentially toxic drugs. These results demonstrate the value of mining toxicoproteomic data sets for modifications.},

@article{Washington2009,
abstract = {Scientists and clinicians who study genetic alterations and disease have traditionally described phenotypes in natural language. The considerable variation in these free-text descriptions has posed a hindrance to the important task of identifying candidate genes and models for human diseases and indicates the need for a computationally tractable method to mine data resources for mutant phenotypes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ontological annotation of disease phenotypes will facilitate the discovery of new genotype-phenotype relationships within and across species. To describe phenotypes using ontologies, we used an Entity-Quality (EQ) methodology, wherein the affected entity (E) and how it is affected (Q) are recorded using terms from a variety of ontologies. Using this EQ method, we annotated the phenotypes of 11 gene-linked human diseases described in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). These human annotations were loaded into our Ontology-Based Database (OBD) along with other ontology-based phenotype descriptions of mutants from various model organism databases. Phenotypes recorded with this EQ method can be computationally compared based on the hierarchy of terms in the ontologies and the frequency of annotation. We utilized four similarity metrics to compare phenotypes and developed an ontology of homologous and analogous anatomical structures to compare phenotypes between species. Using these tools, we demonstrate that we can identify, through the similarity of the recorded phenotypes, other alleles of the same gene, other members of a signaling pathway, and orthologous genes and pathway members across species. We conclude that EQ-based annotation of phenotypes, in conjunction with a cross-species ontology, and a variety of similarity metrics can identify biologically meaningful similarities between genes by comparing phenotypes alone. This annotation and search method provides a novel and efficient means to identify gene candidates and animal models of human disease, which may shorten the lengthy path to identification and understanding of the genetic basis of human disease.},

It is relevant to satisfying the chemical safety assessment requirements of the REACH legislation as it supports access to experimental data, (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship models, and toxicological information through an integrating platform that adheres to regulatory requirements and OECD validation principles. Initial research defined the essential components of the Framework including the approach to data access, schema and management, use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies, architecture, web service and communications protocols, and selection and integration of algorithms for predictive modelling. OpenTox provides end-user oriented tools to non-computational specialists, risk assessors, and toxicological experts in addition to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for developers of new applications. OpenTox actively supports public standards for data representation, interfaces, vocabularies and ontologies, Open Source approaches to core platform components, and community-based collaboration approaches, so as to progress system interoperability goals. The OpenTox Framework includes APIs and services for compounds, datasets, features, algorithms, models, ontologies, tasks, validation, and reporting which may be combined into multiple applications satisfying a variety of different user needs. OpenTox applications are based on a set of distributed, interoperable OpenTox API-compliant REST web services. The OpenTox approach to ontology allows for efficient mapping of complementary data coming from different datasets into a unifying structure having a shared terminology and representation. Two initial OpenTox applications are presented as an illustration of the potential impact of OpenTox for high-quality and consistent structure-activity relationship modelling of REACH-relevant endpoints: ToxPredict which predicts and reports on toxicities for endpoints for an input chemical structure, and ToxCreate which builds and validates a predictive toxicity model based on an input toxicology dataset. Because of the extensible nature of the standardised Framework design, barriers of interoperability between applications and content are removed, as the user may combine data, models and validation from multiple sources in a dependable and time-effective way.},

abstract = {The lipid-lowering agent pravastatin and the antidepressant paroxetine are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. Unexpected interactions between them could have important public health implications. We mined the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) for side-effect profiles involving glucose homeostasis and found a surprisingly strong signal for comedication with pravastatin and paroxetine. We retrospectively evaluated changes in blood glucose in 104 patients with diabetes and 135 without diabetes who had received comedication with these two drugs, using data in electronic medical record (EMR) systems of three geographically distinct sites. We assessed the mean random blood glucose levels before and after treatment with the drugs. We found that pravastatin and paroxetine, when administered together, had a synergistic effect on blood glucose. The average increase was 19 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) overall, and in those with diabetes it was 48 mg/dl (2.7 mmol/l). In contrast, neither drug administered singly was associated with such changes in glucose levels. An increase in glucose levels is not a general effect of combined therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and statins.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Age- and sex-related susceptibility to adverse drug reactions and disease is a key concern in understanding drug safety and disease progression. We hypothesize that the underlying suite of hepatic genes expressed at various life cycle stages will impact susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Understanding the basal liver gene expression patterns is a necessary first step in addressing this hypothesis and will inform our assessments of adverse drug reactions as the liver plays a central role in drug metabolism and biotransformation. Untreated male and female F344 rats were sacrificed at 2, 5, 6, 8, 15, 21, 52, 78, and 104 weeks of age. Liver tissues were collected for histology and gene expression analysis. Whole-genome rat microarrays were used to query global expression profiles. RESULTS: An initial list of differentially expressed genes was selected using criteria based upon p-value (p<0.05) and fold-change (+/- 1.5). Three dimensional principal component analysis revealed differences between males and females beginning at 2 weeks with more divergent profiles beginning at 5 weeks. The greatest sex-differences were observed between 8 and 52 weeks before converging again at 104 weeks. K-means clustering identified groups of genes that displayed age-related patterns of expression. Various adult aging-related clusters represented gene pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism, DNA damage repair, and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an underlying role for genes in specific clusters in potentiating age- and sex-related differences in susceptibility to adverse health effects. Furthermore, such a comprehensive picture of life cycle changes in gene expression deepens our understanding and informs the utility of liver gene expression biomarkers.},

abstract = {Organisms born into the same contaminated environment as their parents can be exposed both maternally and environmentally to contaminants, potentially placing them at greater risk of adverse effects than when exposed via either of the two pathways independently. We examined whether embryonic exposure to maternally derived mercury (Hg) interacts with dietary exposure to negatively influence larval development in American toads ( Bufo americanus ). We collected eggs from breeding pairs at reference and Hg-contaminated sites and monitored performance, development, and survival of larvae fed three experimental Hg diets (total Hg, 0.01, 2.5, and 10 $\mu$g/g). The negative sublethal effects of maternal and/or dietary Hg manifested differently, but maternal Hg exposure had a greater overall influence on offspring health than dietary exposure. However, the combination of sublethal effects of the two exposure routes interacted with lethal consequences; larvae exposed to maternal Hg and high dietary Hg experienced 50\% greater mortality compared to larvae from reference mothers fed the control diet. This study is the first to demonstrate that the latent effects of maternally transferred contaminants may be exacerbated by further exposure later in ontogeny, findings that may have important implications for both wildlife and human health.},

In response to recent reviews of limitations of current concepts and techniques for toxicity testing, this commentary challenges the paradigm that chemicals are directly responsible for DNA damage in the genomic-nuclear DNA in relevant cells of the human body. This challenge is not that mutations do not play roles in human-inherited or somatic diseases but that chemical exposures bring about disease end points by epigenetic mechanisms or by alterations in adult stem cell numbers in utero (ie, the Barker hypothesis) or postnatally, by selecting preexisting mutated cells. Classic concepts, that is, multistage, multimechanism process of carcinogenesis, stem cell theory of cancer, and newer and ignored concepts, such as cancer stem cells and cell-cell communication, will be used to support the view that the toxic effect of chemicals is mediated by nonmutagenic mechanisms at human relevant exposures.},

abstract = {Maintaining the viability of populations of plants and animals is a key focus for environmental regulation. Population-level responses integrate the cumulative effects of chemical stressors on individuals as those individuals interact with and are affected by their conspecifics, competitors, predators, prey, habitat, and other biotic and abiotic factors. Models of population-level effects of contaminants can integrate information from lower levels of biological organization and feed that information into higher-level community and ecosystem models. As individual-level endpoints are used to predict population responses, this requires that biological responses at lower levels of organization be translated into a form that is usable by the population modeler. In the current study, we describe how mechanistic data, as captured in adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), can be translated into modeling focused on population-level risk assessments. First, we describe the regulatory context surrounding population modeling, risk assessment and the emerging role of AOPs. Then we present a succinct overview of different approaches to population modeling and discuss the types of data needed for these models. We describe how different key biological processes measured at the level of the individual serve as the linkage, or bridge, between AOPs and predictions of population status, including consideration of community-level interactions and genetic adaptation. Several case examples illustrate the potential for use of AOPs in population modeling and predictive ecotoxicology. Finally, we make recommendations for focusing toxicity studies to produce the quantitative data needed to define AOPs and to facilitate their incorporation into population modeling.Environ. Toxicol.

abstract = {OpenTox provides an interoperable, standards-based Framework for the support of predictive toxicology data management, algorithms, modelling, validation and reporting. It is relevant to satisfying the chemical safety assessment requirements of the REACH legislation as it supports access to experimental data, (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship models, and toxicological information through an integrating platform that adheres to regulatory requirements and OECD validation principles. Initial research defined the essential components of the Framework including the approach to data access, schema and management, use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies, architecture, web service and communications protocols, and selection and integration of algorithms for predictive modelling. OpenTox provides end-user oriented tools to non-computational specialists, risk assessors, and toxicological experts in addition to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for developers of new applications. OpenTox actively supports public standards for data representation, interfaces, vocabularies and ontologies, Open Source approaches to core platform components, and community-based collaboration approaches, so as to progress system interoperability goals. The OpenTox Framework includes APIs and services for compounds, datasets, features, algorithms, models, ontologies, tasks, validation, and reporting which may be combined into multiple applications satisfying a variety of different user needs. OpenTox applications are based on a set of distributed, interoperable OpenTox API-compliant REST web services. The OpenTox approach to ontology allows for efficient mapping of complementary data coming from different datasets into a unifying structure having a shared terminology and representation. Two initial OpenTox applications are presented as an illustration of the potential impact of OpenTox for high-quality and consistent structure-activity relationship modelling of REACH-relevant endpoints: ToxPredict which predicts and reports on toxicities for endpoints for an input chemical structure, and ToxCreate which builds and validates a predictive toxicity model based on an input toxicology dataset. Because of the extensible nature of the standardised Framework design, barriers of interoperability between applications and content are removed, as the user may combine data, models and validation from multiple sources in a dependable and time-effective way.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are some common occupational agents and exposure circumstances for which evidence of carcinogenicity is substantial but not yet conclusive for humans. Our objectives were to identify research gaps and needs for 20 agents prioritized for review based on evidence of widespread human exposures and potential carcinogenicity in animals or humans. DATA SOURCES: For each chemical agent (or category of agents), a systematic review was conducted of new data published since the most recent pertinent International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monograph meeting on that agent. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers were charged with identifying data gaps and general and specific approaches to address them, focusing on research that would be important in resolving classification uncertainties. An expert meeting brought reviewers together to discuss each agent and the identified data gaps and approaches. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several overarching issues were identified that pertained to multiple agents; these included the importance of recognizing that carcinogenic agents can act through multiple toxicity pathways and mechanisms, including epigenetic mechanisms, oxidative stress, and immuno- and hormonal modulation. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in occupational populations provide important opportunities to understand the mechanisms through which exogenous agents cause cancer and intervene to prevent human exposure and/or prevent or detect cancer among those already exposed. Scientific developments are likely to increase the challenges and complexities of carcinogen testing and evaluation in the future, and epidemiologic studies will be particularly critical to inform carcinogen classification and risk assessment processes.},

However, mounting evidence indicates that even subtle differences in laboratory or test conditions can lead to conflicting test outcomes. Because experimental treatments may interact with environmental conditions, experiments conducted under highly standardized conditions may reveal local 'truths' with little external validity. We review this hypothesis here and present a proof of principle based on data from a multilaboratory study on behavioral differences between inbred mouse strains. Our findings suggest that environmental standardization is a cause of, rather than a cure for, poor reproducibility of experimental outcomes. Environmental standardization can contribute to spurious and conflicting findings in the literature and unnecessary animal use. This conclusion calls for research into practicable and effective ways of systematic environmental heterogenization to attenuate these scientific, economic and ethical costs.},

abstract = {The efforts of the committee that produced the report on Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century reflected the need to look at the issue of assessing risks to humans from exposure to various chemicals through a lens of 21st century biology. The problem - determining if there is a risk of specific exposures - is as old as humanity; every generation brings its own perspective and tools for examining the problem and coming to answers and solutions. Bringing this generation's tools to bear requires us to see the problem of chemical risk assessment in a different light, both in terms of testing of toxicity pathways in vitro and in the interpretation of the tests for estimating whether exposures will be safe. One key issue will be to assess when pathway perturbations are believed to be excessive, i.e., when they are deemed adverse. Redefinition of adversity based on in vitro testing will require a new perception of dose response functions as probabilities of failures, with multiple underlying processes acting sequentially and in parallel leading to failure at a cellular and an organism level. These dose response relationships for adversity will also require a computational systems biology approach for examining toxicity pathway dynamics and stress pathway overload. While the overall approach of defining adversity for in vitro endpoints and using this definition of adversity for risk assessment can be painted in broad brush strokes, as we have done here for DNA-reactive compounds, it will take implementation with a series of prototypes to show the process in practice.},

abstract = {The Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) is a level of human intake or exposure that is considered to be of negligible risk, despite the absence of chemical-specific toxicity data. The TTC approach is a form of risk characterisation in which uncertainties arising from the use of data on other compounds are balanced against the low level of exposure. The approach was initially developed by the FDA for packaging migrants, and used a single threshold value of 1.5 microg/day (called the threshold of regulation). Subsequent analyses of chronic toxicity data resulted in the development of TTC values for three structural classes with different potentials for toxicity (1,800, 540 and 90 microg/day). These TTC values have been incorporated into the procedure that is used internationally for the evaluation of flavouring substances. Further developments included additional TTC values for certain structural alerts for genotoxicity (0.15 microg/day), and for the presence of an organophosphate group (18 microg/day). All of these TTC values were incorporated into an extended decision tree for chemicals, such as contaminants, which might be present in human foods. The TTC approach has been shown to have potential applications to risk assessments of cosmetic ingredients, household products and impurities in therapeutic drugs.},

The SMT has not been rigorously tested, and several lines of evidence raise questions that are not addressed by this theory. Herein, we propose experimental strategies that may validate the SMT. We also call attention to an alternative theory of carcinogenesis, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), which posits that cancer is a tissue-based disease and that proliferation is the default state of all cells. Based on epistemological and experimental evidence, we argue that the TOFT compellingly explains carcinogenesis, while placing it within an evolutionarily relevant context.

abstract = {The use of nanoscale materials is growing exponentially, but there are also concerns about the environmental hazard to aquatic biota. Metal-containing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are an important group of these new materials, and are often made of one metal (e.g., Cu-NPs and Ag-NPs), metal oxides (e.g., ZnO and TiO(2) NPs), or composite of several metals. The physiological effects and toxicity of trace metals in the traditional dissolved form are relatively well known and the overall aim of this review was to use our existing conceptual framework of metal toxicity in fish to compare and contrast the effects of nanometals. Conceptually, there are some fundamental differences that relate to bioavailability and uptake. The chemistry and behaviour of nanometals involves dynamic aspects of aggregation theory, rather than the equilibrium models traditionally used for free metal ions. Some NPs, such as Cu-NPs, may also release free metal ions from the surface of the particle. Biological uptake of NPs is not likely via ion transporters, but endocytosis is a possible uptake mechanism. The body distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nanometals is poorly understood and hampered by a lack of methods for measuring NPs in tissues. Although data sets are still limited, emerging studies on the acute toxicity of nanometals have so far shown that these materials can be lethal to fish in the mg-$\mu$gl(-1) range, depending on the type of material. Evidence suggests that some nanometals can be more acutely toxic to some fish than dissolved forms. For example, juvenile zebrafish have a 48-h LC(50) of about 0.71 and 1.78mgl(-1) for nano- and dissolved forms of Cu respectively. The acute toxicity of metal NPs is not always explained, or only partly explained, by the presence of free metal ions; suggesting that other novel mechanisms may be involved in bioavailability. Evidence suggests that nanometals can cause a range of sublethal effects in fish including respiratory toxicity, disturbances to trace elements in tissues, inhibition of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, and oxidative stress. Organ pathologies from nanometals can be found in a range of organs including the gill, liver, intestine, and brain. These sublethal effects suggest some common features in the sublethal responses to nanometals compared to metal salts. Effects on early life stages of fish are also emerging, with reports of nanometals crossing the chorion (e.g., Ag-NPs), and suggestions that the nano-forms of some metals (Cu-NPs and ZnO NPs) may be more toxic to embryos or juveniles, than the equivalent metal salt. It remains possible that nanometals could interfere with, and/or stimulate stress responses in fish; but data has yet to be collected on this aspect. We conclude that nanometals do have adverse physiological effects on fish, and the hazard for some metal NPs will be different to the traditional dissolved forms of metals.},

Hartung often refers to the proplems with multiple testing and multiple descriptors leading to false positives. 
He praises at the same time in vitro toxicogenomics approaches and pathway analysis systems. 

        
How does he bridge the inherent problems of false positives in such settings?

abstract = {Background: Fetal programming describes the theory linking environmental conditions during embryonic and fetal development with risk of diseases later in life. Environmental insults in-utero may lead to changes in epigenetic mechanisms potentially affecting fetal development. Objectives: We examined associations between in-utero exposures, infant growth, repetitive element and gene-associated DNA methylation in human term placenta tissue samples. Methods: Placental tissues and associated demographic and clinical data were obtained from subjects delivering at Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, RI. LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels were determined in 380 placental samples from term deliveries using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were obtained in a subset of 184 samples using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray. Multiple linear regression, model-based clustering methods and gene set enrichment analysis examined the association between birthweight percentile, demographic variables, repetitive element methylation and gene-associated CpG locus methylation. Results: LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels were found to be significantly positively associated with birthweight percentile (p=0.01 and p<0.0001 respectively), and were found to differ significantly amongst tobacco smoke and alcohol exposed infants. Increased placental AluYb8 methylation was positively associated with average methylation among CpG loci found in polycomb group target genes; developmentally related transcription factor binding sites were over-represented for differentially methylated loci associated with both elements. Conclusions: Our results suggest that epigenetic alterations in repetitive element methylation markers, most notably AluYb8 methylation, may be susceptible to the intrauterine environment, play a critical role in mediating placenta function and ultimately inform on the developmental basis of health and disease.},

abstract = {Two studies were carried out to examine the impact of maternal fipronil exposure on embryonic and offspring development. In the first study, breeding female zebra finches were orally dosed with single sublethal levels of fipronil (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight) to determine behavioural and developmental consequences on chicks following maternal pesticide exposure. Significant levels of fipronil and fipronil-sulfone residues were detected in eggs laid by females in all dosed groups, however, these were undetectable in eggs laid 13 days after treatment. The level of sulfone detected in eggs was consistently higher than that of the parent fipronil compound. Of the seven eggs laid in the treatment groups, only one (14\%) chick hatched and this was from the lowest dose group. This chick was severely underdeveloped at 10 days of age in comparison to control chicks and fiproles were detected in brain, liver, and adipose tissues collected following euthanasia of this individual. In contrast, there was 100\% hatchability of control group eggs and all chicks fledged nests on schedule. In the second study, domestic chicken eggs were injected with 5.5, 17.5, and 37.5 mg/kg egg weight of fipronil directly into the yolk sac on day 12 of incubation. Treatment did not affect hatching success, however, behavioural and developmental abnormalities were observed in hatchlings from the highest dose group. These chicks also demonstrated reduced feeding rates, as indicated by reduced body mass at 48 h period post hatch. Both fipronil and fipronil-sulfone residues were detected in brain and liver tissue of hatchlings at all pesticide dose levels tested.},

abstract = {Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying the pattern of citations among papers stating it. Design A complete citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English literature papers addressing the belief that amyloid, a protein accumulated in the brain in Alzheimers disease, is produced by and injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis. Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network. Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority. Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding. Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.},

@article{Yu2010,
abstract = {Background
Figures are important experimental results that are typically reported in full-text bioscience articles. Bioscience researchers need to access figures to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. On the other hand, the sheer volume of bioscience literature has made it difficult to access figures. Therefore, we are developing an intelligent figure search engine (http://figuresearch.askhermes.org). Existing research in figure search treats each figure equally, but we introduce a novel concept of “figure ranking”: figures appearing in a full-text biomedical article can be ranked by their contribution to the knowledge discovery.

Methodology/Findings
We empirically validated the hypothesis of figure ranking with over 100 bioscience researchers, and then developed unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) approaches to automatically rank figures. Evaluating on a collection of 202 full-text articles in which authors have ranked the figures based on importance, our best system achieved a weighted error rate of 0.2, which is significantly better than several other baseline systems we explored. We further explored a user interfacing application in which we built novel user interfaces (UIs) incorporating figure ranking, allowing bioscience researchers to efficiently access important figures. Our evaluation results show that 92\% of the bioscience researchers prefer as the top two choices the user interfaces in which the most important figures are enlarged. With our automatic figure ranking NLP system, bioscience researchers preferred the UIs in which the most important figures were predicted by our NLP system than the UIs in which the most important figures were randomly assigned. In addition, our results show that there was no statistical difference in bioscience researchers' preference in the UIs generated by automatic figure ranking and UIs by human ranking annotation.

Conclusion/Significance
The evaluation results conclude that automatic figure ranking and user interfacing as we reported in this study can be fully implemented in online publishing. The novel user interface integrated with the automatic figure ranking system provides a more efficient and robust way to access scientific information in the biomedical domain, which will further enhance our existing figure search engine to better facilitate accessing figures of interest for bioscientists.},

abstract = {Although theWeb has transformed science publishing, scientific papers themselves are still essentially “black boxes”, with much of their content intended for human readers only. Typically, computer-readable metadata associated with an article is limited to bibliographic details. By expanding article metadata to include taxonomic names, identifiers for cited material (e.g., publications, sequences, specimens, and other data), and geographical coordinates, publishers could greatly increase the scientific value of their digital content. At the same time this will provide novel ways for users to discover and navigate through this content, beyond the relatively limited linkage provided by bibliographic citation. As a proof of concept, my entry in the Elsevier Grand Challenge extracted extended metadata from a set of articles from the journal Molecular phylogeny and evolution and used it to populate a entity-attribute-value database. A simple web interface to this database enables an enhanced display of the content of an article, including a map of localities mentioned either explicitly or implicitly (through links to geotagged data), taxonomic coverage, and both data and citation links. Metadata extraction was limited to information listed in tables in the articles, such as GenBank sequences and specimen codes. The body of the article wasn’t used, a restriction that was deliberate to demonstrate that making extended metadata available doesn’t require a journal’s publisher to make the full-text freely available (although this is desirable for other reasons)},

@article{Gargouri2010,
abstract = {Background
Articles whose authors have supplemented subscription-based access to the publisher's version by self-archiving their own final draft to make it accessible free for all on the web (“Open Access”, OA) are cited significantly more than articles in the same journal and year that have not been made OA. Some have suggested that this “OA Advantage” may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles OA. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002–2006 in 1,984 journals.

Methdology/Principal Findings
The OA Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression analysis showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and highest for the most highly cited articles. The OA Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20\% of articles receive about 80\% of all citations).

Conclusions/Significance
The OA advantage is greater for the more citable articles, not because of a quality bias from authors self-selecting what to make OA, but because of a quality advantage, from users self-selecting what to use and cite, freed by OA from the constraints of selective accessibility to subscribers only. It is hoped that these findings will help motivate the adoption of OA self-archiving mandates by universities, research institutions and research funders.},

abstract = {Increased public and private investments in large-scale team science initiatives over the past two decades have underscored the need to better understand how contextual factors influence the effectiveness of transdisciplinary scientific collaboration. Toward that goal, the findings from four distinct areas of research on team performance and collaboration are reviewed: (1) social psychological and management research on the effectiveness of teams in organizational and institutional settings; (2) studies of cyber-infrastructures (i.e., computer-based infrastructures) designed to support transdisciplinary collaboration across remote research sites; (3) investigations of community-based coalitions for health promotion; and (4) studies focusing directly on the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of scientific collaboration within transdisciplinary research centers and training programs. The empirical literature within these four domains reveals several contextual circumstances that either facilitate or hinder team performance and collaboration. A typology of contextual influences on transdisciplinary collaboration is proposed as a basis for deriving practical guidelines for designing, managing, and evaluating successful team science initiatives.},

abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at "quasi-baseline" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

abstract = {Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these \&\#8220;data stories\&\#8221; differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

@article{Bollen2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intricate maps of science have been created from citation data to visualize the structure of scientific activity. However, most scientific publications are now accessed online. Scholarly web portals record detailed log data at a scale that exceeds the number of all existing citations combined. Such log data is recorded immediately upon publication and keeps track of the sequences of user requests (clickstreams) that are issued by a variety of users across many different domains. Given these advantages of log datasets over citation data, we investigate whether they can produce high-resolution, more current maps of science. METHODOLOGY: Over the course of 2007 and 2008, we collected nearly 1 billion user interactions recorded by the scholarly web portals of some of the most significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia. The resulting reference data set covers a significant part of world-wide use of scholarly web portals in 2006, and provides a balanced coverage of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. A journal clickstream model, i.e. a first-order Markov chain, was extracted from the sequences of user interactions in the logs. The clickstream model was validated by comparing it to the Getty Research Institute's Architecture and Art Thesaurus. The resulting model was visualized as a journal network that outlines the relationships between various scientific domains and clarifies the connection of the social sciences and humanities to the natural sciences. CONCLUSIONS: Maps of science resulting from large-scale clickstream data provide a detailed, contemporary view of scientific activity and correct the underrepresentation of the social sciences and humanities that is commonly found in citation data.},

However, a library has been described as "thought in cold storage," and unfortunately many digital libraries can be cold, impersonal, isolated, and inaccessible places. In this Review, we discuss the current chilly state of digital libraries for the computational biologist, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, the ACM digital library, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Citeseer, arXiv, DBLP, and Google Scholar. We illustrate the current process of using these libraries with a typical workflow, and highlight problems with managing data and metadata using URIs. We then examine a range of new applications such as Zotero, Mendeley, Mekentosj Papers, MyNCBI, CiteULike, Connotea, and HubMed that exploit the Web to make these digital libraries more personal, sociable, integrated, and accessible places. We conclude with how these applications may begin to help achieve a digital defrost, and discuss some of the issues that will help or hinder this in terms of making libraries on the Web warmer places in the future, becoming resources that are considerably more useful to both humans and machines.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT : CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology for describing the nature of reference citations in scientific research articles and other scholarly works, both to other such publications and also to Web information resources, and for publishing these descriptions on the Semantic Web. Citation are described in terms of the factual and rhetorical relationships between citing publication and cited publication, the in-text and global citation frequencies of each cited work, and the nature of the cited work itself, including its publication and peer review status. This paper describes CiTO and illustrates its usefulness both for the annotation of bibliographic reference lists and for the visualization of citation networks. The latest version of CiTO, which this paper describes, is CiTO Version 1.6, published on 19 March 2010. CiTO is written in the Web Ontology Language OWL, uses the namespace http://purl.org/net/cito/, and is available from http://purl.org/net/cito/. This site uses content negotiation to deliver to the user an OWLDoc Web version of the ontology if accessed via a Web browser, or the OWL ontology itself if accessed from an ontology management tool such as Prot\'{e}g\'{e} 4 (http://protege.stanford.edu/). Collaborative work is currently under way to harmonize CiTO with other ontologies describing bibliographies and the rhetorical structure of scientific discourse.},

abstract = {Galileo wrote that "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics"; his quantitative approach to understanding the natural world arguably marks the beginning of modern science. Nearly 400 years later, the fragmented teaching of science in our universities still leaves biology outside the quantitative and mathematical culture that has come to define the physical sciences and engineering. This strikes us as particularly inopportune at a time when opportunities for quantitative thinking about biological systems are exploding. We propose that a way out of this dilemma is a unified introductory science curriculum that fully incorporates mathematics and quantitative thinking.},

abstract = {High-throughput biological assays let us ask very detailed questions about how diseases operate, and promise to let us personalize therapy. Data processing, however, is often not described well enough to allow for reproduction, leading to exercises in “forensic bioinformatics” where raw data and reported results are used to infer what the methods must have been. Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just methods but errors. In this talk, we examine several related papers using array-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials were allocated to treatment arms based on these results. However, we show in several case studies that the reported results incorporate several simple errors that could put patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common. We briefly discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our own investigations.},

abstract = {With the analysis of complex, messy data sets, the statistics community has recently focused attention on "reproducible research," namely research that can be readily replicated by others. One standard that has been proposed is the availability of data sets and computer code. However, in some situations, raw data cannot be disseminated for reasons of confidentiality or because the data are so messy as to make dissemination impractical. For one such situation, we propose 2 steps for reproducible research: (i) presentation of a table of data and (ii) presentation of a formula to estimate key quantities from the table of data. We illustrate this strategy in the analysis of data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, which investigated the effect of the drug finasteride versus placebo on the period prevalence of prostate cancer. With such an important result at stake, a transparent analysis was important.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in biological data acquisition has made computational analysis essential to research in the life sciences. However, the myriad of software tools to analyze this data were developed in diverse settings, without the capability to interact with one another or to capture the information necessary to reproduce an analysis. The burden of maintaining analytical provenance is therefore placed on the individual scientist. As a consequence, publications in biomedical research usually do not contain sufficient information for reproduction of the presented results. To alleviate these problems, we created a computational genomics environment called GenePattern which tracks the steps in the analysis of genomic data. Recently, in collaboration with Microsoft, we linked GenePattern to Microsoft Word. This resulting combination provides a Reproducible Research System that enables users to link analytical tools into workflows, to automatically record their work, to transparently embed that *recording* into a publication without ever leaving their word processing environment, and importantly to allow exact reproduction of published results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. CONCLUSIONS: We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

abstract = {Digital media and communication networks have become an important cyberinfrastructure to enable new levels of interactions in organizations and communities. A complicated knowledge network of individuals, documents, data, concepts, and their interconnections forms a virtual knowledge repository. To be more effective in using these resources, knowledge discovery tools are crucial for an organization and individual users to identify the right expertise or knowledge resources from this large "multidimensional network." Cyberinfrastructure Knowledge Networks on the Web (CI-KNOW) is a suite of Web-based tools that facilitates discovery of resources within communities. CI-KNOW implements a network recommendation system that incorporates social motivations for why we create, maintain, and dissolve our knowledge network ties. The network data is captured by automated harvesting of digital resources using Web crawlers, text miners, tagging tools that automatically generate community-oriented metadata, and scientometric data such as co-authorship and citations. Based on this knowledge network, the CI-KNOW recommender system produces personalized search results through two steps: identify matching entities according to their metadata and network statistics and select the best fits according to requester's perspectives and connections in social networks. Integrated with community Web portals, CI-KNOW navigation and auditing portlets provide analysis and visualization tools for community members and serves as a research testbed to examine social theories on individuals' motivations for seeking expertise from specific resources (people, documents, datasets, and etc.). As a proof-of-concept, this paper demonstrates how CI-KNOW, integrated with the NCI-supported Tobacco Informatics Grid (TobIG), facilitates knowledge sharing in the tobacco control research community.},

We reevaluate that structure using latent pattern models from statistical machine learning, also known as mixed-membership models, that identify semantic structure in co-occurrence of words in the abstracts and references. Our findings suggest that the latent dimensionality of patterns underlying PNAS research articles in the Biological Sciences is only slightly larger than the number of categories currently in use, but it differs substantially in the content of the categories. Further, the number of articles that are listed under multiple categories is only a small fraction of what it should be. These findings together with the sensitivity analyses suggest ways to reconceptualize the organization of papers published in PNAS.},

abstract = {The transfer of scientific data has emerged as a significant challenge, as datasets continue to grow in size and demand for open access sharing increases. Current methods for file transfer do not scale well for large files and can cause long transfer times. In this study we present BioTorrents, a website that allows open access sharing of scientific data and uses the popular BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing technology. BioTorrents allows files to be transferred rapidly due to the sharing of bandwidth across multiple institutions and provides more reliable file transfers due to the built-in error checking of the file sharing technology. BioTorrents contains multiple features, including keyword searching, category browsing, RSS feeds, torrent comments, and a discussion forum. BioTorrents is available at http://www.biotorrents.net.},

abstract = {As computation emerges as central to the scientific enterprise, new modalities are necessary to ensure scientific findings are reproducible. Without access to the underlying code and data, it is all but impossible to reproducible today’s published computational scientific results. As seen in recent widely reported events, such as Climategate and the clinical trials scandal at Duke University, a lack of transparency in computational research undermines public confidence in science as well as slowing scientific progress, engendering a credibility crisis. In order to communicate scientific discoveries and knowledge through the release of the associated code and data, scientists face issues of copyright. In this talk I address copyright as a barrier to reproducible research and present open licensing solutions for computational science. My efforts, labeled The Reproducible Research Standard, are designed to realign the communication of modern computational scientific research with longstanding scientific norms. With transparency in scientific research, a new era of access to computational science is at hand that does not confine understanding to specialists, but permits knowledge transfer not just between disciplines but to any interested person in the world with an internet connection.},

Spatial cyberinfrastructures will have a higher chance of success if users of many types, including nonprofessionals, are made central to the development process. Recent studies in the history of infrastructures reveal key turning points and issues that should be considered in the development of spatial cyberinfrastructure projects. These studies highlight the importance of adopting qualitative research methods to learn how users work with data and digital tools, and how user communities form. The author's empirical research on data sharing networks in the Pacific Northwest salmon crisis at the turn of the 21st century demonstrates that ordinary citizens can contribute critical local knowledge to global databases and should be considered in the design and construction of spatial cyberinfrastructures.},

abstract = {Healthy aging is thought to reflect the combined influence of environmental factors (lifestyle choices) and genetic factors. To explore the genetic contribution, we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional longevity (EL) in 1055 centenarians and 1267 controls. Using these data, we built a genetic model that includes 150 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found that it could predict EL with 77\% accuracy in an independent set of centenarians and controls. Further in silico analysis revealed that 90\% of centenarians can be grouped into 19 clusters characterized by different combinations of SNP genotypes-or genetic signatures-of varying predictive value. The different signatures, which attest to the genetic complexity of EL, correlated with differences in the prevalence and age of onset of age-associated diseases (e.g., dementia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) and may help dissect this complex phenotype into subphenotypes of healthy aging.},

Data should be archived with enough clarity and supporting information that they can be accurately interpreted by others. Re-users should respect their intellectual debt to the originators of data through citation both of the paper and of the data package. In addition, journals should consider requiring that all data for published papers be archived, just as DNA sequences must be deposited in GenBank. Data are another valuable part of the legacy of a scientific career and archiving them can lead to new scientific insights.

abstract = {We propose that scientific publications recognize the primacy of computational results -- figures,tables, and charts -- and follow a protocol we have developed which asks publishers for subtle, easy changes in article appearance, asks authors for simple easy changes in a few lines of code in their programs and word processors, and yet has very far-reaching and we think lasting consequences. The effect of these small changes will be the following. Each author would permanently register each computational result in a published article (figure, table, computed number in in-line text) with a unique universal result identifier (URI). Each figure or table appearing in a published article would have its URI clearly indicated next to that item: a string that permanently and uniquely identifies that computational result. In our proposal, an archive, run by the publisher under the standard client/server architecture described here, will respond to queries about the URI and provide: (a) the figure/table itself; (b) metadata about the figure's creation; (c) (with permissions) data from the figure/table itself; (d) (with permissions) a related figure/table, obtained by changing the underlying parameters that created the original figure, but keeping everything else about the figure's creation the same. To better evoke the whole package we propose -- which consists of URI's, of specific content associated to URI's, and specific server processes that record and serve up content, we call the whole package -- a URI, its associated content and server behaviors -- a Verifable Computational Result (VCR). Our talk will describe an existing implementation of this idea and the advantages to journals, scientists, and government agencies of this approach.},

abstract = {We live in interesting times. Portents of impending catastrophe pervade the literature, calling us to action in the face of unmanageable volumes of scientific data. But it isn't so much data generation per se, but the systematic burial of the knowledge embodied in those data that poses the problem: there is so much information available that we simply no longer know what we know, and finding what we want is hard - too hard. The knowledge we seek is often fragmentary and disconnected, spread thinly across thousands of databases and millions of articles in thousands of journals. The intellectual energy required to search this array of data-archives, and the time and money this wastes, has led several researchers to challenge the methods by which we traditionally commit newly acquired facts and knowledge to the scientific record. We present some of these initiatives here - a whirlwind tour of recent projects to transform scholarly publishing paradigms, culminating in Utopia and the Semantic Biochemical Journal experiment. With their promises to provide new ways of interacting with the literature, and new and more powerful tools to access and extract the knowledge sequestered within it, we ask what advances they make and what obstacles to progress still exist? We explore these questions, and, as you read on, we invite you to engage in an experiment with us, a real-time test of a new technology to rescue data from the dormant pages of published documents. We ask you, please, to read the instructions carefully. The time has come: you may turn over your papers...},

@book{Owens2010,
abstract = {In December 2009, after years of planning, preparations and extensive infrastructure deployment, the world's first regional-scale underwater ocean observatory was open for business. NEPTUNE Canada opened its instrument network and data archive to free and open access by anyone willing to register for an account. Thus, we have embarked on a journey to transform our observatory into an online platform for collaborative, multidisciplinary e-science. Four main areas of Internet-mediated activity characterize e-science: data provision, analysis \& visualization, collaboration and publication. Data provision entails making our large and ever expanding data archive accessible and searchable through the Web. To support online analysis \& visualization, tools must be developed, which allow scientists to display and manipulate a wide variety of data products derived from measurements gathered by the various instruments attached to the observatory. Virtual collaboration can be fostered by making it easy for groups of geographically or institutionally separated researchers to design experiments, control instruments, share analyses and discuss conclusions within a shared web-based workspace. Publication and dissemination of research findings can be supported by tools that help researchers manage and contribute to both informal outreach (e.g. blogs) and the iterative review and revision cycles required for formal manuscript authoring. E-science promises some tantalizing advantages over traditional approaches. By providing through-the-web access to a large multivariate data archive, researchers are freed from the burdens of data storage and management. Additionally, the archive can simultaneously serve multiple users at multiple institutions in widely separated locations. Community-driven development of analysis routines allows users to visualize the data using both existing and custom-created code. E-science also encourages higher levels of collaboration, allowing resear- - chers to form virtual teams able to tackle complex problems, where expertise in a variety of disciplines is required. Finally, by opening new avenues for interaction between researchers and students or members of the general public, e-science can influence both the questions scientists choose to address and the scope of their investigations. Transforming the promise of e-science into reality, however, is fraught with both technical and organizational challenges. The sheer volume of data records (50+ Tb/year) and observation density pose significant challenges for observatory and researcher alike, requiring new data mining approaches to be developed. Evolving and sometimes competing data format standards must be grappled with. Questions of data reliability and security must be answered. New protocols for protecting intellectual property within an open data environment must be defined. Ground rules for providing equitable access to finite shared resources (eg. underwater camera control time) must be defined. Cultural, institutional and motivational barriers to distributed decision-making and virtual team coordination must be overcome. NEPTUNE Canada is working to address the many challenges of e-science through a wide range of possible solutions. To help researchers make more optimal use of our large and growing data archives, we are developing a facility that allows users to upload and run custom data analysis routines on NEPTUNE Canada servers. Code authors will be able to retain privacy of over their routines, or if desired, publish their code for sharing and possible additional development with the larger user community. NEPTUNE Canada is developing other tools in the form of web and mobile applications for data search and subscription, event detection, interactive data plotting and real-time collaborative multi-user device control. Other custom tools will give users the ability to search, browse and annotate streaming media, then integrate and compile playlists},

@misc{Perez2011,
abstract = {As an active participant of both the scientific research and the open-source software development communities, I have observed that the latter often lives up better than the former to our ideals of scientific openness and reproducibility. I will explore the reasons behind this, and I will argue that these problems are particularly acute in computational domains where they should be in fact less prevalent. Open source software development uses public fora for most discussion and systems for sharing code and data that are, in practice, powerful provenance tracking systems. There is a strong culture of public disclosure, tracking and fixing of bugs, and development often includes exhaustive automatic validation systems, that are executed automatically whenever changes are made to the software and whose output is publicly available on the internet. This helps with early detection of problems, mitigates their reoccurrence, and ensures that the state and quality of the software is a known qunatity under a wide variety of situations (operating systems, inputs, parameter ranges, etc). Additionally, the very systems that are used for sharing the code track the authorship of contributions. All of this ensures that open collaboration does not dilute the merit or recognition of any individual developer, and allows for a meritocracy of contributors to develop while enabling highly effective collaboration. In sharp contrast we have incentives in computational research, strongly biased towards rapid publication of papers without any realistic requirement of validation, that lead to a completely different outcome. Publications in computationally-based research (applied to any specific discipline) often lack any realistic hope of being reproduced, as the code behind them is not available, or if it is it rarely has any automated validation, history tracking, bug database, etc. I will discuss how we can draw specific lessons from the open source community both in terms of technical approaches and of changing the structure of incentives, to make progress towards a more solid base for reproducible computational research.},

DRD is a genetically heterogeneous and clinically complex movement disorder that is usually treated with l-dopa, a precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Whole-genome sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations in the SPR gene encoding sepiapterin reductase. Disruption of SPR causes a decrease in tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor required for the hydroxylase enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. Supplementation of l-dopa therapy with 5-hydroxytryptophan, a serotonin precursor, resulted in clinical improvements in both twins.},

This paper is an experience report on a complementary approach: the growing of a peer review culture among graduate students. We instruct first-year masters and doctoral students on principles for preparing a thesis proposal. Students present their proposals in collective discussion sessions with feedback from professors. The students then submit their proposals through a web interface and are instructed on the role they will play next – of anonymous referees of their peers’ proposals. The referee reports and general statistics are made available to all participating students and advisers. Updated proposals are submitted to an annual workshop open to all participating students and advisers. About 60 students take part in this annual series of seminars with peer review and workshop, generating individual thesis proposals and 180 referee reports, 3 for each proposal. Students and their advisers receive detailed feedback on individual participation as author and referee. The main strength of this experience is the opportunity to assimilate the techniques of objective criticism and to reflect about the quality of own and others’ work.

abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial technological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely reproduce their results. Rather than reproduce this paper exactly we demonstrate that such a reproduction is possible and instead concentrate on demonstrating the usefulness of the compendium concept itself.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Modern biological experiments create vast amounts of data which are geographically distributed. These datasets consist of petabytes of raw data and billions of documents. Yet to the best of our knowledge, a search engine technology that searches and cross-links all different data types in life sciences does not exist. We have developed a prototype distributed scientific search engine technology, 'Sciencenet', which facilitates rapid searching over this large data space. By 'bringing the search engine to the data', we do not require server farms. This platform also allows users to contribute to the search index and publish their large-scale data to support e-Science. Furthermore, a community-driven method guarantees that only scientific content is crawled and presented.

General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58\%. The world's capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28\% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23\%). Humankind's capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6\%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9\% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94\% digital in 2007).},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

In particular, the associations between respiratory hospital admissions in 2005 and exposure to both PM(10) and NO(2) between 2002 and 2004 are estimated using a small-area ecological design. The implementation of such studies requires careful consideration of a number of statistical issues, including how to model spatial correlation, identifiability of the model parameters, and the possible effects of ecological bias. The results show that long-term exposures (over 3 years) to PM(10) and NO(2) are significantly associated with respiratory hospital admissions in Edinburgh and Glasgow, whereas the risks for Aberdeen and Dundee are generally positive but nonsignificant.},

abstract = {A key challenge of ecosystem management is determining how to manage multiple ecosystem services across landscapes. Enhancing important provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber, often leads to tradeoffs between regulating and cultural ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, flood protection, and tourism. We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. Ecosystem service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 ecosystem services in a mixed-use landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada. We identified six types of ecosystem service bundles and were able to link these bundles to areas on the landscape characterized by distinct social-ecological dynamics. Our results show landscape-scale tradeoffs between provisioning and almost all regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and they show that a greater diversity of ecosystem services is positively correlated with the provision of regulating ecosystem services. Ecosystem service-bundle analysis can identify areas on a landscape where ecosystem management has produced exceptionally desirable or undesirable sets of ecosystem services.},

How can we cope with surprises and uncertainties when we cannot predict them? One approach is to make decisions that are robust to a number of different futures. Those interested in global environmental issues have used scenarios - sets of stories about the future - to help discuss those issues and to identify policy alternatives. To date, most global environmental scenarios have treated ecological dynamics as the product of large-scale anthropogenic drivers and have not considered ecological feedbacks to these drivers. Global scenarios could benefit from the input of ecologists, as this would lead to the incorporation of more realistic ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, ecology could benefit from involvement in scenario planning. Unlike many technical models, scenarios, easily understood as stories, can be used for communication and outreach, to build public appreciation of ecological science and the ecological dilemmas we face.},

abstract = {Excessive release of heavy metals, especially cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), results from primitive electronic waste (e-waste) recycling activities in Guiyu, China, and has adverse effects on the health of local infants and pregnant women. We investigated the expression of placental S100P, a Ca(2+)-binding protein, as a biological indicator of heavy-metal environmental pollution in pregnant women involved in these activities and constantly exposed to Cd and Pb. We included 105 pregnant women in the study: 55 from Guiyu and 50 from Shantou, an area not involved in e-waste recycling. The placental concentrations of Cd and Pb (PCCd, PCPb) after birth were measured by graphite-furnace atomic-absorption spectrometry. S100P mRNA expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. S100P protein expression was examined by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The expression of metallothionein (MT), previously found upregulated after heavy metal contamination, was used for comparison. Placentas from Guiyu women showed 62.8\% higher Cd concentrations, higher MT levels, and lower S100P protein levels than placentas from Shantou women. Furthermore, PCCd was negatively correlated with S100P protein expression and positively with MT expression, with no correlation between PCPb and S100P or MT expression. The PCCd-associated downregulation of S100P in placentas from Guiyu women suggests that S100P might be an effective biological indicator in the placental response to Cd toxicity in areas of e-waste recycling.},

abstract = {Despite increasing attention to the human dimension of conservation projects, a rigorous, systematic methodology for planning for ecosystem services has not been developed. This is in part because flows of ecosystem services remain poorly characterized at local-to-regional scales, and their protection has not generally been made a priority. We used a spatially explicit conservation planning framework to explore the trade-offs and opportunities for aligning conservation goals for biodiversity with six ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood control, forage production, outdoor recreation, crop pollination, and water provision) in the Central Coast ecoregion of California, United States. We found weak positive and some weak negative associations between the priority areas for biodiversity conservation and the flows of the six ecosystem services across the ecoregion. Excluding the two agriculture-focused services-crop pollination and forage production-eliminates all negative correlations. We compared the degree to which four contrasting conservation network designs protect biodiversity and the flow of the six services. We found that biodiversity conservation protects substantial collateral flows of services. Targeting ecosystem services directly can meet the multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity goals more efficiently but cannot substitute for targeted biodiversity protection (biodiversity losses of 44\% relative to targeting biodiversity alone). Strategically targeting only biodiversity plus the four positively associated services offers much promise (relative biodiversity losses of 7\%). Here we present an initial analytical framework for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in conservation planning and illustrate its application. We found that although there are important potential trade-offs between conservation for biodiversity and for ecosystem services, a systematic planning framework offers scope for identifying valuable synergies.},

abstract = {Conservation decisions about how, when, and where to act are typically based on our expectations for the future. When the world is highly unpredictable and we are working from a limited range of expectations, however, our expectations will frequently be proved wrong. Scenario planning offers a framework for developing more resilient conservation policies when faced with uncontrollable, irreducible uncertainty. A scenario in this context is an account of a plausible future. Scenario planning consists of using a few contrasting scenarios to explore the uncertainty surrounding the future consequences of a decision. Ideally, scenarios should be constructed by a diverse group of people for a single, stated purpose. Scenario planning can incorporate a variety of quantitative and qualitative information in the decision-making process. Often, consideration of this diverse information in a systemic way leads to better decisions. Furthermore, the participation of a diverse group of people in a systemic process of collecting, discussing, and analyzing scenarios builds shared understanding. The robustness provided by the consideration of multiple possible futures has served several groups well; we present examples from business, government, and conservation planning that illustrate the value of scenario planning. For conservation, major benefits of using scenario planning are (1) increased understanding of key uncertainties, (2) incorporation of alternative perspectives into conservation planning, and (3) greater resilience of decisions to surprise.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss can affect ecosystem functions and services. Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant. However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.},

abstract = {We develop an integrated model to predict private land-use decisions in response to policy incentives designed to increase the provision of carbon sequestration and species conservation across heterogeneous landscapes. Using data from the Willamette Basin, Oregon, we compare the provision of carbon sequestration and species conservation under five simple policies that offer payments for conservation. We evaluate policy performance compared with the maximum feasible combinations of carbon sequestration and species conservation on the landscape for various conservation budgets. None of the conservation payment policies produce increases in carbon sequestration and species conservation that approach the maximum potential gains on the landscape. Our results show that policies aimed at increasing the provision of carbon sequestration do not necessarily increase species conservation and that highly targeted policies do not necessarily do as well as more general policies.},

abstract = {Approaches to natural resource management are often based on a presumed ability to predict probabilistic responses to management and external drivers such as climate. They also tend to assume that the manager is outside the system being managed. However, where the objectives include long-term sustainability, linked social-ecological systems (SESs) behave as complex adaptive systems, with the managers as integral components of the system. Moreover, uncertainties are large and it may be difficult to reduce them as fast as the system changes. Sustainability involves maintaining the functionality of a system when it is perturbed, or maintaining the elements needed to renew or reorganize if a large perturbation radically alters structure and function. The ability to do this is termed "resilience." This paper presents an evolving approach to analyzing resilience in SESs, as a basis for managing resilience. We propose a framework with four steps, involving close involvement of SES stakeholders. It begins with a stakeholder-led development of a conceptual model of the system, including its historical profile (how it got to be what it is) and preliminary assessments of the drivers of the supply of key ecosystem goods and services. Step 2 deals with identifying the range of unpredictable and uncontrollable drivers, stakeholder visions for the future, and contrasting possible future policies, weaving these three factors into a limited set of future scenarios. Step 3 uses the outputs from steps 1 and 2 to explore the SES for resilience in an iterative way. It generally includes the development of simple models of the system's dynamics for exploring attributes that affect resilience. Step 4 is a stakeholder evaluation of the process and outcomes in terms of policy and management implications. This approach to resilience analysis is illustrated using two stylized examples.},

abstract = {The socio-political context of modern environmental health disasters tends to be defined as being outside the scope of official public health and epidemiological investigations into the causes of such disasters. On the other hand, popular accounts of these disasters tend to focus exclusively on the role of particular individuals and/or political actors, while minimizing the role of ecological factors. It is argued that an exclusive focus on either set of causal factors gives an incomplete or distorted picture of the origins of an environmental health disaster. In this paper, a socio-ecological analysis is developed to demonstrate how the largest outbreak of waterborne E. coli O157:H7 in Canadian history was the emergent product of a complex interplay and intertwining of social and ecological processes. The socio-ecological autopsy approach that is developed here traces the social and ecological chain of events that ultimately led to the outbreak and demonstrates, in particular, the need for investigative analysis to focus on the socio-ecological "incubation" of an environmental health disaster. Drawing from both the social sciences (particularly, the sociology of disasters and organizational sociology), and from the ecological sciences (particularly disease ecology), the analysis developed here responds to the call for the application of a more transdisciplinary approach to the study of contemporary environmental health problems.},

@article{Cowling2008,
abstract = {Research on ecosystem services has grown markedly in recent years. However, few studies are embedded in a social process designed to ensure effective management of ecosystem services. Most research has focused only on biophysical and valuation assessments of putative services. As a mission-oriented discipline, ecosystem service research should be user-inspired and user-useful, which will require that researchers respond to stakeholder needs from the outset and collaborate with them in strategy development and implementation. Here we provide a pragmatic operational model for achieving the safeguarding of ecosystem services. The model comprises three phases: assessment, planning, and management. Outcomes of social, biophysical, and valuation assessments are used to identify opportunities and constraints for implementation. The latter then are transformed into user-friendly products to identify, with stakeholders, strategic objectives for implementation (the planning phase). The management phase undertakes and coordinates actions that achieve the protection of ecosystem services and ensure the flow of these services to beneficiaries. This outcome is achieved via mainstreaming, or incorporating the safeguarding of ecosystem services into the policies and practices of sectors that deal with land- and water-use planning. Management needs to be adaptive and should be institutionalized in a suite of learning organizations that are representative of the sectors that are concerned with decision-making and planning. By following the phases of our operational model, projects for safeguarding ecosystem services are likely to empower stakeholders to implement effective on-the-ground management that will achieve resilience of the corresponding social-ecological systems.},

For this reason, recent studies have called for increased attention to development of a theoretical understanding behind the relationships among ecosystem services. Here, we review the literature on ecosystem services and propose a typology of relationships between ecosystem services based on the role of drivers and the interactions between services. We use this typology to develop three propositions to help drive ecological science towards a better understanding of the relationships among multiple ecosystem services. Research which aims to understand the relationships among multiple ecosystem services and the mechanisms behind these relationships will improve our ability to sustainably manage landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Solastalgia is a new concept developed to give greater meaning and clarity to environmentally induced distress. As opposed to nostalgia--the melancholia or homesickness experienced by individuals when separated from a loved home--solastalgia is the distress that is produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment. The paper will focus on two contexts where collaborative research teams have found solastalgia to be evident: the experiences of persistent drought in rural NSW and the impact of large-scale open-cut coal mining on individuals in the Upper Hunter Valley of NSW. In both cases, people exposed to environmental change experienced negative affect that is exacerbated by a sense of powerlessness or lack of control over the unfolding change process. METHODS: Qualitative (interviews and focus groups) and quantitative (community-based surveys) research has been conducted on the lived experience of drought and mining, and the findings relevant to solastalgia are presented. RESULTS: The authors are exploring the potential uses and applications of the concept of solastalgia for understanding the psychological impact of the increasing incidence of environmental change worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide, there is an increase in ecosystem distress syndromes matched by a corresponding increase in human distress syndromes. The specific role played by global-scale environmental challenges to 'sense of place' and identity will be explored in the future development of the concept of solastalgia.},

The trend lines for future loss are steeply upward as new adverse drivers of change come into play. The political processes for matching this crisis are now inadequate and the science needs to address this issue are huge and slow to fulfil, even though strong advances have been made. A more integrated approach to evaluating biodiversity in terms that are meaningful to the larger community is needed that can provide understandable metrics of the consequences to society of the losses that are occurring. Greater attention is also needed in forecasting likely diversity-loss scenarios in the near term and strategies for alleviating detrimental consequences. At the international level, the Convention on Biological Diversity must be revisited to make it more powerful to meet the needs that originally motivated its creation. Similarly, at local and regional levels, an ecosystem-service approach to conservation can bring new understanding to the value, and hence the need for protection, of the existing natural capital.},

abstract = {Biological diversity appears to enhance the resilience of desirable ecosystem states, which is required to secure the production of essential ecosystem services. The diversity of responses to environmental change among species contributing to the same ecosystem function, which we call response diversity, is critical to resilience. Response diversity is particularly important for ecosystem renewal and reorganization following change. Here we present examples of response diversity from both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and across temporal and spatial scales. Response diversity provides adaptive capacity in a world of complex systems, uncertainty, and human-dominated environments. We should pay special attention to response diversity when planning ecosystem management and restoration, since it may contribute considerably to the resilience of desired ecosystem states against disturbance, mismanagement, and degradation.},

Our model of the ecosystem management of lake eutrophication integrates lake dynamics, management decision-making, and learning in a framework that is deliberately simplified to highlight the role of model uncertainty. The simulated lake can switch between alternate eutrophic and oligotrophic states. Managers consider two management models of the lake, one for an oligotrophic lake and the other for a eutrophic lake. As managers observe the lake varying from year to year, they estimate how well each of the two management models is supported by the observed data. Management policies maximize the expected net present value of the lake. Even under optimistic assumptions about environmental variation, learning ability, and management control, conventional decision theory and optimal control approaches fail to stabilize ecological dynamics. Rather, these methods drive ecosystems into cycles of collapse and recovery. We suggest how scientists could help prevent ecosystem management from driving ecosystems toward collapse.},

We need to track the changing status of ecosystems, deepen our understanding of the biological underpinnings for ecosystem service delivery and develop new tools and techniques for maintaining and restoring resilient biological and social systems. We will be building on an ecosystem foundation that has been radically compromised during the past half century. Most rivers have been totally restructured, oceans have been severely altered and depleted, coral reefs are near the tipping point of disappearing as functional ecosystems, over half of the land surface is devoted to livestock and crop agriculture, with little consideration for the ecosystem services that are being lost as a consequence, some irrevocably so. We have already seen many regime shifts, or tipping points, due to human activity, even before the onset of measurable climate change impacts on ecosystems. Climate change, caused mainly by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, will disrupt our ecosystem base in new ways. Already we are seeing widespread signs of change. Species behaviors are altering and disrupting mutualisms of long standing. We are seeing extinctions within vulnerable habitats and conditions where migrations are necessary for survival but where often there are no pathways available for successful movement in the fragmented world of today. These challenges represent an extraordinary threat to society and a call for urgent attention by the scientific community.},

@article{Rodriguez2006a,
abstract = {Ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs arise from management choices made by humans, which can change the type, magnitude, and relative mix of services provided by ecosystems. Trade-offs occur when the provision of one ES is reduced as a consequence of increased use of another ES. In some cases, a trade-off may be an explicit choice; but in others, trade-offs arise without premeditation or even awareness that they are taking place. Trade-offs in ES can be classified along three axes: spatial scale, temporal scale, and reversibility. Spatial scale refers to whether the effects of the trade-off are felt locally or at a distant location. Temporal scale refers to whether the effects take place relatively rapidly or slowly. Reversibility expresses the likelihood that the perturbed ES may return to its original state if the perturbation ceases. Across all four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios and selected case study examples, trade-off decisions show a preference for provisioning, regulating, or cultural services ( in that order). Supporting services are more likely to be "taken for granted." Cultural ES are almost entirely unquantified in scenario modeling; therefore, the calculated model results do not fully capture losses of these services that occur in the scenarios. The quantitative scenario models primarily capture the services that are perceived by society as more important - provisioning and regulating ecosystem services - and thus do not fully capture trade-offs of cultural and supporting services. Successful management policies will be those that incorporate lessons learned from prior decisions into future management actions. Managers should complement their actions with monitoring programs that, in addition to monitoring the short-term provisions of services, also monitor the long-term evolution of slowly changing variables. Policies can then be developed to take into account ES trade-offs at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Successful strategies will recognize the inherent complexities of ecosystem management and will work to develop policies that minimize the effects of ES trade-offs.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services-the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems-are essential to human existence, but demands for services often surpass the capacity of ecosystems to provide them. Lack of ecological information often precludes informed decision making about ecosystem services. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) was conceived in part to provide the necessary ecological information to decision makers. To this end, the MA set out to address the stated needs and concerns of decision makers and examine the ecological dynamics and uncertainties underlying these concerns. To improve our understanding of their information needs and concerns, we interviewed 59 decision makers from five continents. The respondents indicated that although most people generally agree about the ideal state of the planet-free of poverty and extreme inequality, replete with cultural and biological diversity-they often disagree about the best way to achieve these goals. Further, although nonspecialists are generally concerned about the environment and may have a good understanding of some of issues, they often have a more limited grasp of the ecological dynamics that drive the issues of concern. We identify some of the principal uncertainties about ecosystem dynamics and feedbacks that underlie the concerns of decision makers. Each of the papers in this special feature addresses these ecological feedbacks from the perspective of a specific discipline, suggesting ways in which knowledge of ecological dynamics can be incorporated into the MA's assessment and scenario-building process.},

We first used beak morphology to classify a subset of 151 South African bird species into 18 functional groups and calculated both the species-area relationship and the FAR at quarter-degree resolution for South Africa. The relationship between functional and taxonomic richness by cell was quadratic rather than linear, with considerable scatter around the curve. We next looked at the spatial relationships between taxonomic diversity and response diversity (i.e. diversity within functional groups) using an a priori categorization of nearly all South African birds into nine functional groups. The spatial distribution of response richness also showed considerable variation in relation to taxonomic richness. Our results demonstrate a novel approach to linking taxonomic, functional and trophic patterns in space and suggest a way in which conservation planning, which has traditionally had a taxonomic focus, could formally incorporate a more functional and food-web-based approach.},

abstract = {Biological diversity could enhance ecosystem service provision by increasing the mean level of services provided, and/or by providing more consistent (stable) services over space and time. Ecological theory predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of 'stabilizing mechanisms.' However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for and differentiate among three stabilizing mechanisms: density compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response diversity (differential response to environmental variables among species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing the insurance value of seemingly 'redundant' species. Furthermore, the absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes.},

We examined the applicability of this proposal to the coffee agroforests of the Western Ghats, India. Of the six strategies, only one directly addresses livelihood conditions. Their approach has a clear emphasis on conservation and, as currently formulated risks repeating the failures of past integrated conservation and development projects. It fails to place the aspirations of farmers at the core of the agenda. Thus, although we acknowledge and share the broad vision and many of the ideas proposed by this approach, we urge more balanced priority setting by emphasizing people as much as biodiversity through a careful consideration of local livelihood needs and aspirations.},

abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems provide humans with food, forage, bioenergy and pharmaceuticals and are essential to human wellbeing. These systems rely on ecosystem services provided by natural ecosystems, including pollination, biological pest control, maintenance of soil structure and fertility, nutrient cycling and hydrological services. Preliminary assessments indicate that the value of these ecosystem services to agriculture is enormous and often underappreciated. Agroecosystems also produce a variety of ecosystem services, such as regulation of soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, support for biodiversity and cultural services. Depending on management practices, agriculture can also be the source of numerous disservices, including loss of wildlife habitat, nutrient runoff, sedimentation of waterways, greenhouse gas emissions, and pesticide poisoning of humans and non-target species. The tradeoffs that may occur between provisioning services and other ecosystem services and disservices should be evaluated in terms of spatial scale, temporal scale and reversibility. As more effective methods for valuing ecosystem services become available, the potential for 'win-win' scenarios increases. Under all scenarios, appropriate agricultural management practices are critical to realizing the benefits of ecosystem services and reducing disservices from agricultural activities.},

abstract = {The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment distinguishes between supporting, regulating, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. We focus on three services, namely the provision of timber, the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the supporting service of bee pollination for coffee production. Possible trade-offs between the different ecosystem services might result in a reduced attractiveness of afforestation projects when taking pollination services into account. We found that economic losses due to a limited reduction of tree density of a Cordia alliodora plantation can be overcompensated by generating pollination services to adjacent coffee agroforestry systems. Thus, for moderate silvicultural interventions such trade-offs do not necessarily occur. Including additional ecosystem services such as biological pest control or seed dispersal, which are also associated with the enhanced functional biodiversity in less dense tree plantations, might further emphasize the hump-shaped relationship between tree density and forest revenues.

abstract = {The article presents the platform "Pimp your landscape" (PYL), which aims firstly at the support of planners by simulating alternative land-use scenarios and by an evaluation of benefits or risks for regionally important ecosystem services. Second, PYL supports an integration of information on environmental and landscape conditions into impact assessment. Third, PYL supports the integration of impacts of planning measures on ecosystem services. PYL is a modified 2-D cellular automaton with GIS features. The cells have the major attribute "land-use type" and can be supplemented with additional information, such as specifics regarding geology, topography and climate. The GIS features support the delineation of non-cellular infrastructural elements, such as roads or water bodies. An evaluation matrix represents the core element of the system. In this matrix, values in a relative scale from 0 (lowest value) to 100 (highest value) are assigned to the land-use types and infrastructural elements depending on their effect on ecosystem services. The option to configure rules for describing the impact of environmental attributes and proximity effects on cell values and land-use transition probabilities is of particular importance. User interface and usage of the platform are demonstrated by an application case. Constraints and limits of the recent version are discussed, including the need to consider in the evaluation, landscape-structure aspects such as patch size, fragmentation and spatial connectivity. Regarding the further development, it is planned to include the impact of land management practices to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in regional planning.},

abstract = {The agro-ecosystems of semi-arid and dry sub-humid SSA are inherently dynamic. At this point in time they are also experiencing a series of complex social-ecological changes that make their future even more uncertain. To ensure that development investments made today in the small-scale farming systems that dominate these regions make sense also in a long-term perspective they should benefit the local communities over a range of potential futures. We applied a participatory scenario planning approach to a smallholder farming community in semi-arid Tanzania, exploring four alternative development trajectories for the area, to increase the robustness of current investments in small-scale water system technologies. We found that water system technologies will be important across a number of possible futures, but that the most relevant target of these innovations, e. g., staple-versus cash-crop production, or individual-versus community-managed systems, differs. We argue that building capacity for experimentation among farmers is key to upgrading their farming systems, as this will generate benefits over a range of alternative futures. Furthermore, we found it to be essential across a range of scenarios to analyze the system-level impact of proposed interventions for successful investments in water system technologies. We conclude that although the method presents some challenges, participatory scenario planning is a useful tool for integrating research and development projects in the larger context, as it increases the understanding of events and processes that may either challenge the project or provide opportunities for it.},

Expected changes offer benefits to northern Wisconsin residents but also threaten to degrade the ecological services they rely on. Because the future of this region is uncertain, it is difficult to make decisions that will avoid potential risks and take advantage of potential opportunities. We adopt a scenario planning approach to cope with this problem of prediction. We use an ecological assessment framework developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment to determine key social and ecological driving forces in the Northern Highlands Lake District. From these, we describe three alternative scenarios to the year 2025 in which the projected use of ecological services is substantially different. The work reported in this paper demonstrates how scenarios can be developed for a region and provides a starting point for a participatory discussion of alternative futures for northern Wisconsin. Although the future is unknowable, we hope that the assessment process begun in this paper will help the people of the Northern Highlands Lake District choose the future path of their region.},

abstract = {Abstract Mediterranean cork oak savannas, which are found only in southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa, are ecosystems of high socioeconomic and conservation value. Characterized by sparse tree cover and a diversity of understory vegetation – ranging from shrub formations to grasslands – that support high levels of biodiversity, these ecosystems require active management and use by humans to ensure their continued existence. The most important product of these savannas is cork, a non-timber forest product that is periodically harvested without requiring tree felling. Market devaluation of, and lower demand for, cork are causing a decline in management, or even abandonment, of southwestern Europe's cork oak savannas. Subsequent shrub encroachment into the savanna's grassland components reduces biodiversity and degrades the services provided by these ecosystems. In contrast, poverty-driven overuse is degrading cork oak savannas in northwestern Africa. “Payment for ecosystem services” schemes, such as...},

Ecological changes pose special challenges for long-term thinking, because of the possibility of regime shifts that occur rapidly yet alter the availability of ecosystem services for generations. Moreover, ecological feedbacks can intensify human modification of ecosystems, creating a spiral of poverty and ecosystem degradation. Such complex dynamics were evaluated by a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analyses in the MA scenarios. Collectively, the scenarios explore problems such as the connections of poverty reduction and ecosystem services, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. Several promising approaches are considered by the scenarios, including uses of biodiversity to build resilience of ecosystem services, actively adaptive management, and green technology. Although the scenarios do not prescribe an optimal path, they illuminate the consequences of different policies toward ecosystem services.},

Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social-ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex social-ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Estimation of tree growth is based on sparse observations of tree diameter, ring widths, or increments read from a dendrometer. From annual measurements on a few trees (e.g., increment cores) or sporadic measurements from many trees (e.g., diameter censuses on mapped plots), relationships with resources, tree size, and climate are extrapolated to whole stands. There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for "filling the gaps" for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth. An example involving multiple species and multiple stands with tree-ring data and up to 14 years of tree census data illustrates how different levels of information at the tree and stand level contribute to inference and prediction.},

abstract = {Abstract A unified theory in science is a theory that shows a common underlying set of rules that regulate processes previously thought to be distinct. Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species-area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

annote = {Ehrlich and Raven's paper was the first essay explicitly focused on coevolution. It's a detailed description, based on the compilation of an extensive body of information, of the antagonistic interactions between butterflies and the plants used as food by their larvae. They suggested that the elaboration of biochemical defenses by some plants and the adaptive responses of butterflies have played a major role in the evolutionary radiation and diversification of both groups. They wrote: "We hold that plants and phytophagous insects have evolved in part in response to one another". 

        
Although they coined the term coevolution, they didn't define it. Since then, there have been misleading uses of the term, as Daniel H. Janzen pointed out (When is it coevolution? Evolution, 1980). Most of these cases associate the term coevolution to interspecific interactions, such as predator-prey, host-parasite, and mutualism. Is important to keep in mind that interacting species can coevolve, but not necessarily.

        
Janzen's definition of coevolution is restricted to pair-wise interactions: "evolutionary change in a trait of the individuals in one population in response to a trait of the individuals of a second population, followed by an evolutionary response by the second population to the change in the first". When either of both populations in the above definition are represented by more than one species, Janzen refers to the process as "diffuse coevolution". A more general definition of coevolution is given by John N. Thompson: "reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species driven by natural selection" (The coevolutionary process, 1994).},

abstract = {The current massive degradation of habitat and extinction of species is taking place on a catastrophically short timescale, and their effects will fundamentally reset the future evolution of the planet's biota. The fossil record suggests that recovery of global ecosystems has required millions or even tens of millions of years. Thus, intervention by humans, the very agents of the current environmental crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery or maintenance of the biota. Many current recovery efforts have deficiencies, including insufficient information on the diversity and distribution of species, ecological processes, and magnitude and interaction of threats to biodiversity (pollution, overharvesting, climate change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, introduced or invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation through land use, disruption of community structure in habitats, and others). A much greater and more urgently applied investment to address these deficiencies is obviously warranted. Conservation and restoration in human-dominated ecosystems must strengthen connections between human activities, such as agricultural or harvesting practices, and relevant research generated in the biological, earth, and atmospheric sciences. Certain threats to biodiversity require intensive international cooperation and input from the scientific community to mitigate their harmful effects, including climate change and alteration of global biogeochemical cycles. In a world already transformed by human activity, the connection between humans and the ecosystems they depend on must frame any strategy for the recovery of the biota.},

We tested constraints for reidentifying the correct structures of 29 known metabolite peaks from GCT premier accurate mass chemical ionization GC-TOF mass spectrometry data without any use of mass spectral libraries. Correct elemental formulas were retrieved within the top-3 hits for most molecular ion adducts using the "Seven Golden Rules" algorithm. An average of 514 potential structures per formula was downloaded from the PubChem chemical database and in-silico-derivatized using the ChemAxon software package. After chemical curation, Kovats retention indices (RI) were predicted for up to 747 potential structures per formula using the NIST MS group contribution algorithm and corrected for contribution of trimethylsilyl groups using the Fiehnlib RI library. When matching the range of predicted RI values against the experimentally determined peak retention, all but three incorrect formulas were excluded. For all remaining isomeric structures, accurate mass electron ionization spectra were predicted using the MassFrontier software and scored against experimental spectra. Using a mass error window of 10 ppm for fragment ions, 89\% of all isomeric structures were removed and the correct structure was reported in 73\% within the top-5 hits of the cases.},

abstract = {Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is found globally as an environmental contaminant and is highly bioaccumulative in exposed biota including humans. However, there is a dearth of environmental information on the isomeric profile of PFOS, especially in biological samples, which requires suitable analysis methods for the identification and quantification of ultratrace amounts. In the present study, a novel method was developed that incorporates clean up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) WAX cartridges and in-port derivatization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify and quantitatively determine linear PFOS (L-PFOS) and branched (monotrifluoromethyl and bistrifluoromethyl) isomers in PFOS technical product and in environmentally relevant biological samples. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) was used for derivatization via an in situ pyrolytic alkylation reaction that occurred in the GC injector and generated butyl PFOS isomer derivatives. In addition to L-PFOS, ten branched PFOS isomers were identified in the technical product. The environmental relevance of branched PFOS isomers in addition to L-PFOS was evidenced by the presence of six branched and L-PFOS in representative herring gull and double-crested cormorant egg, and polar bear liver and plasma samples from the Great Lakes and Arctic, respectively. For all PFOS isomers in the technical product and biota samples the method demonstrated high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL, with exception of L-PFOS where the LOD was 1.46 ng/mL. For the biotic samples, the method detection limits (MDLs) were slightly higher than the LODs and ranged from 0.09 to 0.46 ng/g wet weight (w.w.) with exception of L-PFOS (MDL = 6.87 ng/g w.w.).},

Hydroxylated metabolites were extracted using liquid-to-liquid extraction, resolved on a C18 column with gradient elution and detected by mass spectrometry in single ion recording mode using electrospray negative ionization. The assay was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of quantification, range and recovery. Calibration curves were linear (R2 > or = 0.98) over a concentration range of 0.010-1.0 microM for 4-OH-2,2',3,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (4-OH-BDE-90), 5'-OH-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (5'-OH-BDE-99) and 6'-OH-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (6'-OH-BDE-99), and a concentration range of 0.0625-12.5 microM for 2,4,5-tribromophenol (2,4,5-TBP). Inter- and intra-day accuracy values ranged from -2.0\% to 6.0\% and from -7.7\% to 7.3\%, respectively, and inter- and intra-day precision values ranged from 2.0\% to 8.5\% and from 2.2\% to 8.6\% (n=6), respectively. The limits of quantification were 0.010 microM for 4-OH-BDE-90, 5'-OH-BDE-99 and 6'-OH-BDE-99, and 0.0625 microM for 2,4,5-TBP. Recovery values ranged between 85 and 100\% for the four analytes. The validated analytical method was applied to identify and quantify hydroxy BDE-99 metabolites formed in vitro. Incubation of BDE-99 with rat liver microsomes yielded 4-OH-BDE-90 and 6'-OH-BDE-99 as major metabolites and 5'-OH-BDE-99 and 2,4,5-TBP as minor metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first validated UPLC/MS method to quantify hydroxylated metabolites of PBDEs without the need of derivatization.},

For Fourier transform mass analyzers (orbitrap and ICR), higher charge also improves signal-to-noise ratio, mass resolution, and mass accuracy. Addition of m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (m-NBA) or sulfolane has previously been shown to increase the charge states of proteins. Moreover, polar aprotic dimethylformamide (DMF) improves chromatographic separation of proteolytic peptides for mass analysis of solution-phase protein hydrogen/deuterium exchange for improved (78-96\%) sequence coverage. Here, we show that addition of each of the various modifiers (DMF, thiodiglycol, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and N-methylpyrrolidone) can significantly increase the charge states of proteins up to 78 kDa. Moreover, incorporation of the same modifiers into reversed-phase liquid chromatography solvents improves sensitivity, charging, and chromatographic resolution for intact proteins.},

The method was applied to the determination of PBBs and PBDEs in several kinds of real EEE samples. It was found that no detectable level of PBBs was detected among them. Different contents of PBDEs were tested in the tested samples and the total contents ranged from 25.0 ng g(-1) to 194.0 ng g(-1).

With this method 28 different marine lipophilic biotoxins can be analysed in a single run. Separation was achieved with an acetonitrile/water gradient containing ammonium hydroxide (pH 11). All toxins were stable under these basic conditions. Compared to chromatography using an acidic gradient, the limit of detection (LODs) for okadaic acid, yessotoxin, gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl spirolide C were improved two- to three-fold, mainly due to better peak shapes. The azaspiracids and pectenotoxins-2 showed comparable LODs under acidic and basic conditions. A major advantage of the developed method is that toxins can be clustered in retention time windows separated for positively and negatively ionized molecular ions. Therefore, there is no need for rapid polarity switching or two separate runs for one sample. The new method showed good repeatability and reproducibility and is an important step in the development of alternatives to the animal tests currently in use for shellfish toxin analysis.},

abstract = {Antimony is a common contaminant at abandoned sites for non-ferrous ore mining and processing. Because of the possible risk of antimony by transfer to plants growing on contaminated sites, it is of importance to analyze antimony and its species in such biota. A method based on high performance liquid chromatographic separation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-ICP-MS) was developed to determine inorganic antimony species such as Sb(III) and Sb(V) as well as possible antimony-organic metabolisation products of the antimony transferred into plant material within one chromatographic run. The separation is performed using anion chromatography on a strong anion exchange column (IonPac AS15/AG 15). Based on isocratic optimizations for the separation of Sb(III) and Sb(V) as well as Sb(V) and trimenthylated Sb(V) (TMSb(V)), a chromatographic method with an eluent gradient was developed. The suggested analytical method was applied to aqueous extracts of Chinese break fern Pteris vittata samples. The transfer of antimony from spiked soil composites into the fern, which is known as a hyperaccumulator for arsenic, was investigated under greenhouse conditions. Remarkable amounts of antimony were transferred into roots and leaves of P. vittata growing on spiked soil composites. Generally, P. vittata accumulates not only arsenic (as shown in a multiplicity of studies in the last decade), but also antimony to a lower extent. The main contaminant in the extracts was Sb(V), but also elevated concentrations of Sb(III) and TMSb(V) (all in microg L(-1) range). An unidentified Sb compound in the plant extracts was detected, which slightly differ in elution time from TMSb(V).},

Selected cells amenable to permanently grow in culture are genetically manipulated to stably express single CYP enzymes originating from any species of interest. This expression can be characterized by, for example, determining CYP mRNA content, CYP protein level (western blotting or in situ immunofluorescence) and CYP-mediated enzyme activity (substrate conversion assays). These cells can be used to determine substrate specificities and species differences, e.g., in the bioactivation of drugs. Once constructed, CYP-expressing cells can serve as a straightforward and reliable tool in toxicity testing and the corresponding assays could be adapted for high-throughput analysis. Using these cells, enzyme assays can be performed in a matter of hours. This protocol is exemplified with V79 fibroblasts from Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus), modified to express human cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1). These cells are characterized for their CYP1B1-linked properties by in situ immunofluorescence and their activity in the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase enzyme assay. This is followed by an assay showing metabolic activation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dibenzo[a,l]pyrene by CYP1B1, along with the toxicological endpoints of cytotoxicity and micronucleus formation.},

abstract = {This protocol describes an analytical platform for the analysis of intra- and extracellular metabolites of microbial cells (yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The protocol is subdivided into sampling, sample preparation, chemical derivatization of metabolites, GC-MS analysis and data processing and analysis. This protocol uses two robust quenching methods for microbial cultures, the first of which, cold glycerol-saline quenching, causes reduced leakage of intracellular metabolites, thus allowing a more reliable separation of intra- and extracellular metabolites with simultaneous stopping of cell metabolism. The second, fast filtration, is specifically designed for quenching filamentous micro-organisms. These sampling techniques are combined with an easy sample-preparation procedure and a fast chemical derivatization reaction using methyl chloroformate. This reaction takes place at room temperature, in aqueous medium, and is less prone to matrix effect compared with other derivatizations. This protocol takes an average of 10 d to complete and enables the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of metabolites from the central carbon metabolism (amino and nonamino organic acids, phosphorylated organic acids and fatty acid intermediates) using an in-house MS library and a data analysis pipeline consisting of two free software programs (Automated Mass Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) and R).},

The four probes were electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) and APCI/APPI; the four LC systems were ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with or without post-column split, a mixed-mode column and two-dimensional LC (2D-LC). Dansylated compounds with ESI at UPLC condition had the most intense signals and less matrix effects of the various combinations of ionization and LC systems. The on-column limits of detection (LODs) of dansylated estrogens by SRM were 0.05-0.20 pg, and the LODs in sewage treatment plant effluent and in river water were 0.23-0.52 and 0.56-0.91 ng/L, respectively. The LODs using selected ion monitoring (SIM) reached low ng/L levels in real samples and measured concentrations were comparable with those of SRM.},

abstract = {The present article reviews the available literature on the analytical and environmental aspects of tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A), a currently intensively used brominated flame retardant (BFR). Analytical methods, including sample preparation, chromatographic separation, detection techniques, and quality control are discussed. An important recent development in the analysis of TBBP-A is the growing tendency for liquid chromatographic techniques. At the detection stage, mass-spectrometry is a well-established and reliable technology in the identification and quantification of TBBP-A. Although interlaboratory exercises for BFRs have grown in popularity in the last 10 years, only a few participating laboratories report concentrations for TBBP-A. Environmental levels of TBBP-A in abiotic and biotic matrices are low, probably due to the major use of TBBP-A as reactive FR. As a consequence, the expected human exposure is low. This is in agreement with the EU risk assessment that concluded that there is no risk for humans concerning TBBP-A exposure. Much less analytical and environmental information exists for the various groups of TBBP-A derivatives which are largely used as additive flame retardants.},

The procedure involved hydrolysis, extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether, defattening and final clean-up with solid phase extraction (SPE) on Oasis HLB and Amino cartridges. The analytes were analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS/MS, in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two diagnostic product ions from each of the chosen precursor ions for the unambiguous confirmation of the hormones. The method was validated at the validation level of 0.5ng/g. The accuracy and precision of the method were satisfactory. The decision limits CCalpha ranged from 0.03 to 0.14ng/g while the detection capabilities CCbeta ranged from 0.05 to 0.24ng/g. The developed method is sensitive and useful for detection, quantification and confirmation of these anabolic steroids in muscle tissue and can be used for residue control programs.},

Using peak lists generated with the Leco ChromaTOF software as input, we developed retention time correction and data alignment tools (INCA). The accuracy of peak alignment and detection of 1.1- to 4-fold changes in metabolite concentration was validated by a spike-in experiment with 20 standard compounds. A list of 48 significant features that differentiated the two E. coli strains was obtained with an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05. A total of 27 metabolites, mainly from the citrate cycle, were identified. That the signal intensity of the m/z 73 trace of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group reflected true differences in metabolite abundance was confirmed by quantification of pyruvate, fumarate, malate, succinate, alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate, cis-aconitate, myo-inositol, and glucose-6-phosphate using compound specific fragment ions and stable isotope labeled standards. Relative standard deviations for metabolite extraction and GC x GC-TOF-MS analysis of those analytes ranged from 13.2 to 26.3\% for the universal m/z 73 trace and 7.4 to 24.5\% for the analyte specific fragment ion trace.},

abstract = {Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor mediating the adverse effects of dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, we investigated the genetic-, time-, dose-, species- and tissue-dependent AhR-mediated agonistic/antagonistic activities of three food flavonoids: quercetin, chrysin and genistein. To that end, four stably transfected cell lines were used in cell-based luciferase reporter gene assays: three lines were transformed with the ptKLuc vector harbouring four dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase gene (HepG2-Luc, T-47D-Luc and H4IIE-ULg). The fourth is a patented cell line transformed with a different construct: H4IIE DR-CALUX((R)). Both H4IIE cells were compared for their genetic construction. Human hepatoma (HepG2-Luc) and human breast tumour (T-47D-Luc) cells were compared for tissue-dependent effects. Rat hepatoma (H4IIE-ULg) and human hepatoma (HepG2-Luc) cells were compared for species-dependent activities. We concluded that quercetin, chrysin and genistein act in a time-, dose-, species- and tissue-specific way. For example, genistein displayed agonistic activities when exposed to rat hepatoma cells during 6h but not after 24h. Flavonoids displayed agonistic/antagonistic activities in human breast tumour cells, depending on the exposure time, while in human hepatoma cells, only antagonistic activities of flavonoids were measured. In addition, we report, in all the cells, a synergy between an isoflavone and two food contaminants; the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-methylcholanthrene, a PAH. In rat cells, this synergy occurred when cells were exposed to flavonoids and contaminant for 6h, while it was observed in human cells only after 24h.},

Different extraction parameters (extraction temperature and time, type of solvent, particle size) were first optimised for standard high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) samples containing known amounts of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and decabromodiphenyl ether (Deca-BDE). Complete extraction of TBBPA was achieved using a combination of polar/non-polar solvent system (isopropanol/n-hexane) and high extraction temperatures (130 degrees C). Lower extraction yields were, however, obtained for Deca-BDE, due to its high molecular weight and its non-polar nature. The developed method was successfully applied to the screening of BFRs in standard plastic samples from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE); TBBPA could be fully recovered, and Deca-BDE could be identified, together with minor order polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners.},

From among the six column combinations that were evaluated, DB-1x007-65HT was found to be the most suitable because of: (i) the highest number of BDE congeners separated; (ii) the least decomposition of higher brominated congeners; and (iii) the most suitable maximum operating temperature. The separation of the 125 BDE congeners from five hydroxy- and two methoxy-BDEs and nine other brominated flame retardants (polybrominated biphenyls, tetrabromobisphenol-A, methyl-tetrabromobisphenol-A and hexabromocyclododecane) was also studied. Fluorinated BDEs were found to be valuable internal standards for the determination of BDEs because of their very similar physico-chemical properties and excellent separation from the parent BDEs, mainly in the second dimension. GCxGC-time-of-flight MS and GCxGC-muECD were shown to be useful tools to identify decomposition products of nona- and deca-substituted BDEs, which are formed during the GC run. Three nona-BDEs were shown to be the major decomposition products of BDE 209.},

abstract = {A step by step strategy of optimization of comprehensive off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separations is proposed. The goal of an optimization process in the separation sciences is either to achieve a given resolution (a target peak capacity in 2D-LC) within as short a time as possible or to reach the highest possible resolution in a given analysis time. The proposed method takes into account the characteristics of the columns used in the first and the second dimension and the number of fractions of the first dimension eluent that should be collected. The effect of the time spent during the analysis on the second dimension column to carry out necessary tasks that are not the separation itself (called the additional time) on the maximum peak capacity that is achievable was carefully investigated. It was shown that (1) an increase in the peak capacity of the first dimension column combined with the collection of larger volume fractions permits a significant reduction of the time needed to achieve the desired peak capacity; and (2) there is an optimum fraction collection ratio (or number of collected fractions per peak) which yields the target peak capacity in the minimum time. The proposed strategy was used for the optimization of the separation of samples of BSA tryptic digest by an off-line 2D-LC using an SCXmultiply sign in circleRP-HPLC method. As a result of this optimization, a peak capacity of 4000 could be achieved in about 5h with the two columns available. The time needed for the optimized analysis was less than two thirds of the analysis time that would have been needed had the conventional rule of thumb of sample collection in comprehensive on-line 2D-LC (4 samples/peak) been followed.},

abstract = {This work presents an exploratory study of the photochemical degradation process of decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) and gives an interpretation of the kinetic pathway, species and effects of the key factors involved in the degradation process. Use of lowly brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) has been banned by the EU and there seems to be evidence of the photolytic degradation of highly brominated PBDEs into lowly brominated congeners. Hence, the importance of knowing the photodegradation process of decaBDE. The photodegradation was investigated under UV light by UV-spectrophotometric monitoring. A novel hybrid data analysis approach, based on the combination of hard- and soft-spectrophotometric multivariate curve resolution, was applied to elucidate the mechanism of the degradation process, to resolve kinetic profiles and pure spectra of the photodegradation products and to evaluate the rate constants. The photodegradation process could be described with a kinetic model based on three consecutive first-order reactions and a decrease of the degradation process was observed as solvent polarity increased. Complementary identification of photodegradation products by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization (GC-NCI-MS) is attempted. This work presents a novel attempt of describing in a comprehensive way the photochemical degradation process of decaBDE, with all successive steps and related rate constants. This study proves also the potential of the proposed hybrid data analysis methodology as a general strategy to interpret the evolution of these photochemical reactions.},

abstract = {A method has been developed for the simultaneous analysis of hydroxylated and methoxylated analogs of tetrabromodiphenyl ethers (OH-tetraBDEs and MeO-tetraBDEs) and of hydroxylated and methoxylated analogs of tetrabromobiphenyl (diOH-tetraBB and diMeO-tetraBB) using high performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-LC/MS/MS) in negative ion mode. Chromatographic separation was performed on a 150 mm ODS column with acetonitrile:water (9:1, v/v) in mobile phase. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was performed using the precursor [M-H]- ion for hydroxylated analogs, and the [M-Br+O]- ion for tetraBDEs and tetraBB, and their methoxylated analogs. The method was validated using cod liver oil samples spiked with nine analytes (100 ng/g) for linearity (r2 > 0.998), recovery (75-95\%), repeatability (8-36\% RSD), and sensitivity (limits of quantification (LOQ), 0.1-0.25 ng/g lipid for phenolic analytes and 6-80 ng/g lipid for neutral brominated compounds). The APCI-LC/MS/MS was applied to analyze tiger shark and bull shark liver samples, where their concentrations were up to 8 ng/g (lipid weight) for OH-BDEs, whereas they were up to 540 ng/g (lipid weight) for MeO-BDEs. The results were consistent with values determined by electron ionization (EI)-GC/MS. The first detection of 2,2'-dihydroxy-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl (2,2'-diOH-BB80) by this method was in marine sponge from Micronesia. The advantage of the LC/MS/MS method over GC/MS is that it provides rapid and simultaneous determination of OH-BDEs, MeO-BDEs, and their related analogs with a single preparation step and without the involvement of chemical derivatives. Although the method provides the different LOQ ranges between hydroxylated and neutral brominated analogs, future work could apply the method to the full range of PBDE-like contaminants present in the environment and in biota tissues.},

abstract = {During wastewater treatment, many organic micropollutants undergo microbially mediated reactions resulting in the formation of transformation products (TPs). Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters. Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan. A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides. The results showed that the complementary use of the target and non-target screening methods allowed for a more comprehensive interpretation of the TPs generated than either would have provided individually.},

abstract = {The feasibility of utilizing a gas chromatograph-tandem quadrupole-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS-FTICRMS) to analyze chlorinated-dioxins/furans (CDDs/CDFs) and mixed halogenated dioxins/furans (HDDs/HDFs) was investigated by operating the system in the GC-FTICRMS mode. CDDs/CDFs and mixed HDDs/HDFs could be analyzed at 50,000 to 100,000 resolving power (RP) on the capillary gas chromatographic time scale. Initial experiments demonstrated that 1 pg of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 5 pg of 2-bromo-3,7,8-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (BTrCDD) could be detected. The feasibility of utilizing an FTICRMS for screening of CDDs/CDFs, HDDs/HDFs and related compounds was also investigated by analyzing an extract from vegetation exposed to fall-out from an industrial fire. CDDs/CDFs, chlorinated pyrenes and chlorinated tetracenes could be detected from a Kendrick plot analysis of the ultrahigh resolution mass spectra. Mass accuracies were of the order of 0.5 ppm on standards with external mass calibration and 1 ppm on a sample with internal mass calibration.},

@article{Rosenfelder2010,
abstract = {Nontarget analysis and identification of unknown polyhalogenated compounds is important in acquiring a thorough picture of the present pollution status as well as for identifying emerging environmental problems. Such analyses usually require the application of electron ionization mass spectrometry because the resulting mass spectra frequently allow for compound identification. When quadrupoles are used as mass separators, the full scan technique often suffers from low sensitivity along with nonspecificity for polyhalogenated trace compounds which often result in interference by matrix compounds. We have developed a novel nontarget gas chromatography/electron ionization-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) method that overcomes these sensitivity and selectivity issues. Our method is based on the fact that the molecular ions and isotope patterns of polyhalogenated compounds involve the most relevant primary information with regard to the structure of polyhalogenated compounds. Additionally, the retention times of polyhalogenated compounds generally increase with increasing molecular weight. The retention time range of polyhalogenated compounds was divided in three partly overlapping segments of 112 u (segment A: m/z 300-412; segment B: m/z 350-462; segment C: m/z 450-562) that were screened in eight GC runs consisting of 15 consecutive SIM ions. This method was tested with a passive water sampler extract known to contain over 30 polyhalogenated compounds according to the sensitive analysis by GC/electron capture negative ion (ECNI)-MS. While none of these polyhalogenated compounds could be detected by GC/EI-MS in full scan mode, our nontarget GC/EI-MS-SIM method allowed for the detection of 38 polyhalogenated compounds. Only seven could be identified by means of reference standards while more than 15 of the unknowns could be traced back to at least the class of compounds based on the mass spectrometric data from the nontarget SIM runs. All compounds identified originated from halogenated natural products. The nontarget GC/EI-MS-SIM method combines the high sensitivity obtainable with quadrupole systems for trace analysis with the structural information essential for the identification of unknown pollutants.},

abstract = {A comprehensive, sensitive and high-throughput liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure photoionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-APPI-MS/MS) method has been developed for analysis of 36 halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). Under the optimized LC conditions, all of the HFRs eluted from the LC column within 14min, while maintaining good chromatographic separation for the isomers. Introduction of the pre-heated dopant to the APPI source decreased the background noise fivefold, which enhanced sensitivity. An empirical equation was proposed to describe the relation between the ion intensity and dopant flow. The excellent on-column instrument detection limits averaged 4.7pg, which was similar to the sensitivity offered by gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). This method was used to analyze a series of fish samples. Good agreement was found between the results for PBDEs from LC-APPI-MS/MS and GC-HRMS.},

Among a number of extraction and clean-up methods tested, pressurized liquid extraction followed by gel permeation chromatography and florisil clean-up proved to be simple, robust and optimized so that all target analytes (parent compounds and metabolites) were collected in a single fraction. Extracts were analyzed by GC-HRMS to identify PBDEs. Following, the same extracts were derivatized and re-analyzed by GC-HRMS to determine 11 target and 35 non-target OH- and MeO-PBDEs. Monitoring of the M(+) for MeO-PBDEs and the [M-CH(2)CO](+) ions for derivatized OH-PBDEs at 10,000 resolution permitted unequivocal identification of the PBDE metabolites in the environmental matrices examined. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, detection limits and long-term stability. The analytical precision obtained with this method was between 0.3 and 17\%, and the limits of quantification were lower than 3.28 pg/g dry weight, 20.5 and 41.4 pg/g lipid weight in sediment, milk and fish, respectively. The method was applied to determine PBDEs and target and non-target metabolites in all three matrices.},

We performed multiple high-throughput measurements to study the response of Escherichia coli cells to genetic and environmental perturbations. Analysis of metabolic enzyme gene disruptants revealed unexpectedly small changes in messenger RNA and proteins for most disruptants. Overall, metabolite levels were also stable, reflecting the rerouting of fluxes in the metabolic network. In contrast, E. coli actively regulated enzyme levels to maintain a stable metabolic state in response to changes in growth rate. E. coli thus seems to use complementary strategies that result in a metabolic network robust against perturbations.},

abstract = {The use of automated flow injection with MS/MS detection for fast quantitation of agrochemicals in food and water samples was demonstrated in this study. Active ingredients from the sulfonylurea herbicide and carbamate insecticide classes were selected as model systems. Samples were prepared using typical procedures from residue methods, placed in an autosampler, and injected directly into a triple quadrupole instrument without chromatographic separation. The technique allows data acquisition in 15 s per injection, with samples being injected every 65 s, representing a significant improvement from the 15-30 min needed in typical HPLC/MS/MS methods. The availability of HPLC systems is an advantage since they can be used in flow-injection mode (bypassing the column compartment). Adequate accuracy, linearity, and precision (R(2) > 0.99 and RSD < 20\%) were obtained using external standards prepared in each control matrix. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) achieved for all analytes was 0.01 mg/kg in food samples and 0.1 ng/mL in water; while limits of detection (LOD) were estimated to be about 0.003 mg/kg and 0.03 ng/mL in food and water, respectively. The advantages and limitations of flow injection MS/MS for ultratrace-level quantitative analysis in complex matrixes are discussed.},

abstract = {A combination of fast GC with narrow-bore column and bench top quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) detector in negative chemical ionization (NCI) mode (with methane as reagent gas) is set up and utilized for the ultratrace analysis of 25 selected pesticides. The observed pesticides, belonging to the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), were from different chemical classes. A comparative study with electron impact (EI) ionization was also carried out (both techniques in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode). The programmed temperature vaporizer (PTV) injector in solvent vent mode and narrow-bore column (15mx0.15mm I.D.x0.15microm film of 5\% diphenyl 95\% dimethylsiloxane stationary phase) were used for effective and fast separation. Heptachlor (HPT) as internal standard (I.S.) was applied for the comparison of results obtained from absolute and normalized peak areas. Non-fatty food matrices were investigated. Fruit (apple - matrix-matched standards; orange, strawberry, plum - real samples) and vegetable (lettuce - real sample) extracts were prepared by a quick and effective QuEChERS sample preparation technique. Very good results were obtained for the characterization of fast GC-NCI-MS method analysing EDCs pesticides. Analyte response was linear from 0.01 to 150microgkg(-1) with the R(2) values in the range from 0.9936 to 1.0000 (calculated from absolute peak areas) and from 0.9956 to 1.0000 (calculated from peak areas normalized to HPT). Instrument limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were found at pgmL(-1) level and for the majority of analytes were up to three orders of magnitude lower for NCI compared to EI mode. In both ionization modes, repeatability of measurements expressed as relative standard deviation (RSDs) was less than 10\% which is in very good agreement with the criterion of European Union.},

abstract = {The present paper deals with the presentation in a new interpretation of sediment quality assessment. This original approach studies the relationship between ecotoxicity parameters (acute and chronic toxicity) and chemical components (polluting species like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heavy metals) of lake sediments samples from Turawa Lake, Poland by an application of self-organising maps (SOMs) to the monitoring dataset (59 samplesx44 parameters) in order to obtain visual images of the components distributed at each sampling site when all components are included in the classification and data projection procedure. From the SOMs obtained, it is possible to select groups of similar ecotoxicity (either acute or chronic) and to analyse within each one of them the relationship of the other chemicals to the toxicity determining parameters (EC(50) and mortality). Studies have shown, convincingly, that different regions from the Turawa Lake bottom indicate different patterns of ecotoxicity related to various chemical pollutants, such as the "heptachlor-B" pattern, "pesticide and PAH" pattern, "structural" pattern or "PCB congeners" pattern. Thus, an easy way of multivariate analysis of small datasets with ecotoxicity parameters involved becomes possible. Additionally, a distinction between the effects of pollution on acute and chronic toxicity seems reasonable.},

To our knowledge, highly chlorinated PAHs, such as C(14)H(3)Cl(7) and C(16)H(3)Cl(7), and ClBr-PAHs, such as C(14)H(7)Cl(2)Br and C(16)H(8)ClBr, were found in the environmental samples for the first time.

On-column limits of detection were between 2.4 and 27.8 pg for the eight congeners studied, with an intra-day method precision of 9\%. The LC/NI-APPI/MS/MS method was validated for the analysis of the eight PBDE congeners in NIST SRM 2585 (Organics in House Dust). Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with subsequent LC/NI-APPI/MS/MS analysis afforded quantitative recovery for all eight PBDE congeners with recoveries ranging from 92.7 to 113\%.

abstract = {Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), used as additive brominated flame retardants, are of high concern due to their widespread use and increasing levels in various environmental systems. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of HBCD diastereoisomers. A detailed study was carried out to optimize the composition of the mobile phase involving methanol/acetonitrile/water, and the values of MS/MS parameters. It was found that the mobile phase could simultaneously affect the chromatographic separation and sensitivity. The instrumental limits of detection (LODs) on column in this study were 0.5, 0.3 and 0.3 pg for alpha-HBCD, beta-HBCD and gamma-HBCD, respectively. The effects of extracted matrix components on HBCD determination were investigated by spiking air and soil sample extracts with three 13C-labelled individual stereoisomers. The results indicated that the responses of the HBCD analysis in air and soils were not significantly affected by matrix effects. The method reported here was further applied to the air and soil samples. Three HBCD diastereoisomers were detected in all the air and soil samples, with levels ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 pg/m3 and 1.7 to 5.6 ng/g dry weight, respectively.},

abstract = {The 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are among the most toxic compounds known, and several sources of exposure to these chemicals should be monitored to protect human and environmental health. The current predominant method of analysis is too expensive and cumbersome, and comprehensive two-dimensional GC coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC--TOF-MS) has the potential to lower the costs and speed analysis of PCDD/Fs. In this study, GC x GC--TOF parameters were evaluated and optimized to yield complete separation of the 17 most important PCDD/F congeners from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) interferences, and to attain the lowest detection limits. The optimization study entailed evaluation of oven temperature programs, column flow rates, ion source temperatures, electron ionization energy, data acquisition rate, and various GC x GC parameters, including modulation period, modulator temperature offset and hot pulse duration. After optimization, all 17 PCDD/Fs were separated in <60 min, and in particular, the critical pair of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and pentachlorobiphenyl congener CB126 did not co-elute chromatographically. Accurate identification and determination of all analytes could be made using their deconvoluted full mass spectra. In GC x GC, the modulation period and start time were the most important factors that affected sensitivity and selectivity for the analysis of the PCDD/Fs. The modulation period should be < or = 4s to preserve separations achieved in one-dimensional GC, and the modulation start time was important to achieve one large slice and two smaller symmetrical slices of TCDD to maximize its detection sensitivity. After optimization, the method could identify 0.25 pg of TCDD with standard injection from its full mass spectrum.},

A mobile phase methanol/acetone/water was used, where acetone acts also as dopant. NI-APPI produced precursor ions corresponding to [M-H](-) for TBBP-A, [M-Br+O](-), and [M-2Br+O](-) for the BDE congeners studied. Each compound was quantified operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Linearity was observed in the range 0.025-10 ng injected for all compounds. Coefficients of determination R(2) ranged from 0.9934 to 0.9982. BDEs were poorly retained by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from river water and sewage treatment plant effluent, thus liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by n-hexane should be used for these samples. The recoveries of TBBP-A and PBDEs from tap water (SPE), river water and industrial wastewater (LLE) were in the range of 81-88\%, 78-92\%, and 43-99\%, respectively, with relative standard deviations below 17\%. The limits of detection, based on signal-to-noise ratio of 3, ranged from 0.004 to 0.1 ng injected, and method quantification limits were 0.2-3.3 ng L(-1) but BDE47 (20.3 ng L(-1)). Only TBBP-A was found in a treated industrial sewage at 4 ng L(-1), while BDE-99 and BDE-100 were detected on suspended solids.},

The nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS method employing a stone-arch microcolumn with amino propyl silica gel achieved good separation of phosphorus metabolites with forty- to hundred-fold increase of sensitivity compared with semimicro flow LC-ESI-MS. The quantitative reproducibility of the nanoLC-ESI-MS has been improved to the point where it is useful for studies of cellular metabolism. Focused metabolomics using culture-derived internal standards was employed to monitor 184 phosphorus-related metabolic changes in cancer cells treated with metabolic enzyme inhibitors, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine. We found marked perturbations of cellular metabolism, of which many, though not all, were in line with the known biological activities of these drugs.},

abstract = {Gas chromatography/multiphoton ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/MPI/TOF-MS) was developed for trace analysis of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The use of an ultraviolet femtosecond laser (266 nm) allowed the sensitive, as well as selective, determination of PCDD/Fs with short singlet-excited-state lifetimes; the detection limit was 19 fg for 1,3,6,8-tetraCDF. Performance of the analytical instrument was examined and was ascertained to be satisfactory for all the criteria (K0311) prescribed by the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS). The relative ionization efficiencies of (12)C-native PCDD/Fs against (13)C-labeled PCDD/Fs were 1.002 +/- 0.012. This suggests that (13)C-labeled isotopes can be used as internal standards with no intensity calibration and that the concentrations of PCDD/Fs can be determined to within an error of ca. 1\%. In addition, multiphoton ionization provides negligible levels of background interference for the real soil samples even with curtailed pretreatment. The toxicity equivalence (TEQ) of the real sample was determined using GC/MPI/TOF-MS for performance evaluation against high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The results suggest equivalent or even superior performance for GC/MPI/TOF-MS, due to low background interference and to the ability to check the reliability of the assignment from the intensity distribution of the isotope peaks.},

We recently demonstrated that when administered to female rat by oral route, DBDE is efficiently absorbed, with the highest residual concentrations found in two endocrine glands, namely the adrenal glands and the ovaries. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging, a technique usually used for the study of endogenous compounds, was applied for the first time to a persistent organic pollutant, allowing to detect and to precisely localize DBDE residues in these two target tissues. The detection of the bromide ion ((81)Br isotope) by TOF-SIMS mass spectrometry imaging allowed us to demonstrate a marked cortical tropism of DBDE residues for the adrenal glands in female rats dosed per os 2 mg·kg(-1) DBDE, daily, over 96 h. In ovaries, DBDE residues were found to be concentrated in spots corresponding to part of the corpora lutea. Hepatic residues of DBDE were found to be homogeneously distributed. Due to the intrinsic toxicity of DBDE, its accumulation in the adrenal glands and the ovaries may be connected to the mechanisms of actions by which DBDE could trigger endocrine disruption in mammals.},

Here we present a workflow for metabolomics in microplate format which affords high-throughput and yet quantitative monitoring of primary metabolism in microorganisms and in particular yeast. First, the most critical step of rapid sampling was adapted to a multiplex format by using fritted 96-well plates for cultivation, which ensure fast sample transfer and permit us to use well-established quenching in cold solvents. Second, extensive optimization of large-volume injection on a GC/TOF instrument provided the sensitivity necessary for robust quantification of 30 primary metabolites in 0.6 mg of yeast biomass. The metabolome profiles of baker's yeast cultivated in fritted well plates or in shake flasks were equivalent. Standard deviations of measured metabolites were between 10\% and 50\% within one plate. As a proof of principle we compared the metabolome of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the single-deletion mutant Delta sdh1, which were clearly distinguishable by a 10-fold increase of the intracellular succinate concentration in the mutant. The described workflow allows the production of large amounts of metabolome samples within a day, is compatible with virtually all liquid extraction protocols, and paves the road to quantitative screens.},

abstract = {Multi-dimensional analysis (MDA) in analytical chemistry is often applied to improve the selectivity of an analytical device and, therefore, to achieve a better overview of a sample composition. Recently, the hyphenation of thermogravimetry with single photo ionization mass spectrometry (TG-SPIMS) using an electron beam pumped excimer lamp (EBEL) for VUV radiation was applied. The concept of MDA has been realized by upgrading the TG-SPIMS system with a quasi comprehensive chromatographic separation step before the soft ionization (TG-GCxSPIMS). The system was characterized by the thermal analysis of diesel fuel, which has often been investigated by the GCxGC-community and is therefore a well-known sample material in MDA. Data from this measurement are used to explain the three-dimensional data structure and the advantages of the online TG-GCxSPIMS as compared to TG-SPIMS. Subsequently, the thermal decomposition behavior of a polymer, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), is investigated. TG-GCxSPIMS provides a two-dimensional analysis of the evolved gaseous products. TG relevant data are obtained as well as an improved resolution power to separate isobaric molecular structures without losing any fraction of the samples, as is often the case in heart cutting approaches. Additionally, this solution is not associated with any extension of the measurement time. The assignment of the substance pattern to distinct species is improved as compared to solely using mass spectrometry without a preceding separation step. Furthermore, hitherto undetected compounds have been found in the evolved gases from the thermal degradation of ABS. Finally, a first estimation of the limit of detection has been carried out. This results in a significant decrease of the LOD in case of TG-GCxSPIMS (500 ppt for toluene) as compared to 30 ppb, which could be reached with TG-SPIMS.},

abstract = {Characterization of prenatal exposure to hazardous chemicals most often relies upon the analysis of cord blood. However, human placenta is an appropriate tissue alternative with noteworthy advantages. Owing to analytical challenges, reports on placental levels of toxic chemicals are limited. The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable, cost-effective, and relatively fast and simple method to extract polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) from human placenta for analysis using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) method was optimized for the extraction and analysis of 43 PBDEs (including BDE209) from human placenta samples. Different sorbents, sample conditions, grinding methods, elution solvents, and single and repeated extractions were compared for their effects on the extraction efficiency. The performance of the optimized method was validated by analyzing spiked placenta samples and a standard reference material of fish tissue. Congener specific PBDE recovery ranged from 91\% to 114\% for the spiked samples and 89\% to 115\% for a standard reference material (SRM) of fish tissue. The optimized MSPD procedure was compared with two conventional extraction methods. The extraction efficiency of MSPD was found to be comparable with that of the traditional Soxhlet method and superior to that using a liquid extraction method. Twenty two PBDEs were detected in all of the five samples collected in Chicago in 2008. This is the first description of PBDEs detected in human placentas in the U.S.},

abstract = {An analytical method comprised of automated solid-phase extraction and determination using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (single quadrupole) has been developed for the determination of 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 26 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), two organochlorine compounds (OCs) (hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene) and two brominated phenols (pentabromophenol, and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A)). The analytes were extracted using a sorbent of polystyrene-divinylbenzene and an additional clean-up was performed on a sulphuric acid-silica column to remove lipids. The method has been validated by spiking horse serum at five levels. The mean accuracy given as recovery relative to internal standards was 95\%, 99\%, 93\% and 109\% for the PBDEs PCBs, OCs and brominated phenols, respectively. The mean repeatability given as RSDs was respectively 6.9\%, 8.7\%, 7.5\% and 15\%. Estimated limits of detection (S/N=3) were in the range 0.2-1.8 pg/g serum for the PBDEs and phenols, and from 0.1 pg/g to 56 pg/g serum for the PCBs and OCs. The validated method has been used to investigate the levels of PBDEs and PCBs in 21 pooled serum samples from the general Norwegian population. In serum from men (age 40-50 years) the sum of seven PBDE congeners (IUPAC No. 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183) increased from 1977 (0.5 ng/g lipids) to 1998 (4.8 ng/g lipids). From 1999 to 2003 the concentration of PBDEs seems to have stabilised. On the other hand, the sum of five PCBs (IUPAC No. 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) in these samples decreased steadily from 1977 (666 ng/g lipids) to 2003 (176 ng/g lipids). Tetrabromobisphenol-A and BDE-209 were detected in almost all samples, but no similar temporal trends to that seen for the PBDEs were observed for these compounds, which might be due to the short half-lives of these brominated flame retardants (FR) in humans.},

abstract = {It is well documented and experimentally confirmed that hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) tend to associate with several anions forming different adducts that can affect the sensitivity and the accuracy of the determinations. In the present work, two different approaches for HBCD determination have been optimised and characterised based on their repeatability and intermediate precision, linear calibration ranges, sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification and application to commercial food samples. Both methods involve the use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a liquid chromatograph and the addition of different ammonium salts to the mobile phase, i.e. ammonium chloride or ammonium acetate, in order to encourage (Cl method) or try to inhibit (Ac method), respectively, the formation of the chlorine adducts of the molecular ion. Precision of the two methods investigated was similar and both approaches presented a comparable behaviour for the analysis of food samples. However, the Cl method showed higher sensitivity and the limits of detection (0.23-0.41 pg on column) and quantification (0.77-1.35 pg on column) were up to 14 times lower than those obtained applying the Ac method. All these facts make the Cl method the best choice for the quantification of HBCDs in food samples with low concentration levels.},

abstract = {A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor was developed for the determination of the insecticide carbaryl and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), the main metabolite of the insecticide chlorpyrifos and of the herbicide triclopyr. The detection was based on a competitive conjugate-immobilized immunoassay format using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hapten conjugates were covalently immobilized, via thioctic acid self-assembled monolayer (SAM), onto the gold electrode sensitive surface of the quartz crystal. This covalent immobilization allowed the reusability of the modified electrode surface for at least one hundred and fifty assays without significant loss of sensitivity. The piezoimmunosensor showed detection limits (analyte concentrations producing 10\% inhibition of the maximum signal) of 11 and 7 microg l(-1) for carbaryl and TCP, respectively. The sensitivity attained (I(50) value) was around 30 microg l(-1) for both compounds. Linear working ranges were 15-53 microg l(-1) for carbaryl and 13-83 microg l(-1) for TCP. Each complete assay cycle took 20 min. The good sensitivity, specificity, and reusability achieved, together with the short response time, allowed the application of this immunosensor to the determination of carbaryl and TCP in fruits and vegetables at European regulatory levels, with high precision and accuracy.},

abstract = {A method for the determination of ultra-trace amounts of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in river water was developed by using stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) followed by thermal desorption and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SBSE-TD-GC×GC-HRTOF-MS). SBSE conditions such as extraction time profiles, phase ratio ($\beta$: sample volume/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) volume), and modifier addition, were examined. Fifty milli-liter sample including 10\% acetone was extracted for 3h using stir bars with a length of 20mm and coated with a 0.5mm layer of PDMS (PDMS volume, 47$\mu$L). The stir bar was thermally desorbed and subsequently analyzed by GC×GC-HRTOF-MS. The method showed good linearity over the concentration range from 50 to 1000pgL(-1) or 2000pgL(-1) for all analytes, and the correlation coefficients (r(2)) were greater than 0.9903 (except for $\beta$-HCH, r(2)=0.9870). The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 10 to 44pgL(-1). The method was successfully applied to the determination of 16 OCPs at pgL(-1) to ngL(-1) in river water. The results agree fairly well with the values obtained by a conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE)-GC-HRMS (selected ion monitoring: SIM) method using large sample volume (20L). The method also allows screening of non-target compounds, e.g. pesticides and their degradation products, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and metabolites in the same river water sample, by using full spectrum acquisition with accurate mass in GC×GC.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones are essential hormones for regulating growth and development in humans and wildlife. Methods to monitor precise and low levels of these hormones in serum and tissues are needed to assess overall health, whether from disease considerations or possibly from environmental contaminant exposures. Common and routine methods typically rely upon radioimmunoassays, which can be expensive, and typically only measure thyroxine and 3,3',5-triidothyronine, which can be a limitation in fully evaluating impacts on thyroid regulation. In this study we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of five thyroid hormones--thyroxine, 3,3',5-triidothyronine, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine, 3,3'-diiodothyronine, and 3,5-diiodothyronine--in serum samples. The LC-MS/MS parameters were optimized and calibrated over a wide concentration range (1.0-500 ng/mL) with on-column detection limits of 1.5-7.0 pg. With use of spiked bovine serum samples, the mean method recoveries were calculated to be 81.3-111.9\% with relative standard deviations of 1.2-9.6\% at spiking levels ranging from 10 to 100 ng/mL. This method was compared with measurements made by standard radioimmunoassays and with measurements made in a serum Standard Reference Material (SRM 1951b). Development of this method expands the capacity to measure thyroid hormones by including a larger suite of thyroid hormones, and has promising applications for measuring catabolism of thyroid hormones in vitro.},

The method is based on gas chromatography coupled to low-resolution mass spectrometry in negative ion chemical ionization mode. It allows determination of these compounds at concentration levels lower than 10(-14)g. A programmed temperature vaporization injector has been used to ensure maximum compound transfer to the chromatographic column while maintaining low thermal degradation levels of the more brominated congeners. Selectivity was increased by modification of the MS source parameters for optimization of the abundance of the high mass fragment ions. Under optimized condition, good repeatability (1.7-9.1\%) and reproducibility (4.1-20\%), and low detection limits, ranging between 1.5 and 15 pg ml(-1), were obtained. These features afforded reliable quantification of these compounds in snow and human samples at the concentrations in which these compounds are found.},

abstract = {The impact of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) on the environment and their potential risk in animal and human health is a present concern. Therefore, existing legislation in the European Union demands that polymers with BFRs are identified and eliminated from the recycling process due to their potential health hazard. In this work, a flow-injection (FI) system coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was optimized for the detection of traces of bromine in polymers, plastic paints and enamels containing BFRs. Sample preparation requires a microwave-assisted digestion in order to transfer bromine in polymeric samples to solution. After appropriate optimization of the digestion procedure and the ICP-MS detection, a detection limit (DL) of 4.2 mg kg(-1) was obtained for synthesized polyurethane standards containing known concentrations of bromine. The precision of the proposed method, evaluated as the R.S.D. of signals obtained for three replicates of polymeric standard BFRs at the normative EU level, was as low as 3.6\%. This simple developed methodology was characterized for the screening of bromine in polymeric matrices. The proposed system provides rapid binary yes/no overall responses, being appropriate for the screening of bromine above a pre-set concentration threshold. The unreliability region (UR), given by the probability of false positives and false negatives (set at 5\% in both cases), was in the range between 442 and 678 mg kg(-1) of bromine (at a cut-off level of 0.1\% in BFRs by weight of homogeneous material fixed by the EU normative). Finally, the applicability of the proposed screening system was tested for the reliable control of bromine in different commercial samples including flame-retardant paints and enamels.},

The off-line coupling of CE to the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the proteins mixture was applied. The cathode end of the capillary was placed inside a stainless steel needle using a coaxial liquid-sheath-flow configuration. The optimization of experimental parameters resulted in an efficient methodology for MS analysis of fractions. Several components contained in the extract of S. japonica were identified, some not previously known. It was demonstrated that low sensitivity, which is a real problem in off-line CE-MS analysis, could be tolerated because of a more flexible optimization of the CE separation conditions and the choice of independent stand-alone instruments for analysis of separated fractions. The estimated limit of detection for CE-RP-HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS was 50 microM of polyphenols and for CE-ICP-MS, 1-100 microg/l.},

abstract = {The potential of gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) for screening anthropogenic organic contaminants in human breast adipose tissues has been investigated. Initially a target screening was performed for a list of 125 compounds which included persistent halogen pollutants [organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenylss (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)], polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols, and a notable number of pesticides from the different fungicide, herbicide and insecticide families. Searching for target pollutants was done by evaluating the presence of up to five representative ions for every analyte, all measured at accurate mass (20-mDa mass window). The experimental ion abundance ratios were then compared to those of reference standards for confirmation. Sample treatment consisted of an extraction with hexane and subsequent normal-phase (NP) High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or SPE cleanup. The fat-free LC fractions were then investigated by GC-TOF MS.Full-spectral acquisition and accurate mass data generated by GC-TOF MS also allowed the investigation of nontarget compounds using appropriate processing software to manage MS data. Identification was initially based on library fit using commercial nominal mass libraries. This was followed by comparing the experimental accurate masses of the most relevant ions with the theoretical exact masses with calculations made using the elemental composition calculator included in the software.The application of both target and nontarget approaches to around 40 real samples allowed the detection and confirmation of several target pollutants including p,p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Several nontarget compounds that could be considered anthropogenic pollutants were also detected. These included 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-toluene (BHT) and its metabolite 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (BHT-CHO), dibenzylamine, N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA), some naphthalene-related compounds and several PCBs isomers not included in the target list. As some of the compounds detected are xenoestrogens, the methodology developed in this paper could be useful in human breast cancer research.},

The elements were separated from cement sample by pyrolysis, and were subsequently determined with ion chromatography. A pyrolysis method was investigated for the separation of micro amounts of these elements from cement. Total time taken to determine these elements is about 45 min including 25 min for the pyrolysis and 18 min for ion chromatography. The results of recovery tests ranged 95\% or above. The limits of detection for F, Cl and Br are 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 mg kg(-1), respectively. The method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of F, Cl and Br in commercial ordinary Portland cements.},

abstract = {The feasibility of heart-cut MDGC-ECD and GCxGC-muECD for the separation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been evaluated. Among the different column combinations tested, the best results were obtained when using either a DB-5 type or an HT-8 column as the first dimension combined with a mid-polar stationary phase (50\% phenyl) as the second dimension. The co-elutions between the target PCBs and PBDEs in the first dimension were satisfactorily resolved once transferred to the second column. Repeatability and intermediate precision were satisfactory in both systems, considering retention times in both dimensions. Nevertheless, peak area/volume precision was better for heart-cut MDGC since software for the data analysis in the case of GCxGC was still under development. The need for multiple injections of the same extract on the heart-cut MDGC system was the main drawback since the analysis time it increased. GCxGC becomes then a valuable alternative able to achieve the same performance in one injection. However, the GCxGC data analysis is still very time-consuming and needs further development. The applicability of both separation techniques was shown using a human breast milk sample with low concentrations of PCBs (0.2-227 pg/g fresh weight) and PBDEs (1.2-41 pg/g fresh weight).},

The method employs solid-phase dispersion on diatomaceous earth in a solid-phase extraction cartridge followed by automated addition of internal standards ((13)C-labeled). Extraction is then performed using an automated modular solid-phase extraction system. The extraction procedure includes drying the sample on diatomaceous earth by pressurized nitrogen and eluting target analytes and lipids with dichloromethane. Lipid content is determined gravimetrically. Lipid determinations performed using this method are compared with other standard methods and with a certified reference material. A relative standard deviation of 7.9\% was obtained for 130 determinations of the lipid content in a breast milk quality control sample. Final analytical determination of target analytes was performed by gas chromatography-isotope dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. Relative standard deviations for the measurements of target analytes for which a labeled internal standard was available were below 10\% for analytes at concentrations above 1 ng/g of lipid. Mean recoveries of the (13)C-labeled internal standards ranged from 60 to 89\% for the eight PBDE congeners; 74 and 113\% were recovered for BB-153 and CB-153, respectively.},

The optimal setup for our purpose was further validated against a set of serum samples from 30 healthy individuals. We also assessed the reproducibility of chromatographic columns with the same chemistry of stationary phase from the same manufacturer but from different production batches.

abstract = {Ubiquitous chemicals may interfere with the thyroid system that is essential in the development and physiology of vertebrates. We applied a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor-based screening method for the fast screening of chemicals with thyroxine (T4) transport disrupting activity. Two inhibition assays using the main thyroid hormone transport proteins, T4 binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin (TTR), in combination with a T4-coated biosensor chip were optimized and automated for screening chemical libraries. The transport protein-based biosensor assays were rapid, high throughput and bioeffect-related. A library of 62 chemicals including the natural hormones, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and metabolites, halogenated bisphenol A (BPA), halogenated phenols, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and other potential environmentally relevant chemicals was tested with the two assays. We discovered ten new active compounds with moderate to high affinity for TBG with the TBG assay. Strikingly, the most potent binding was observed with hydroxylated metabolites of the brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) BDE 47, BDE 49 and BDE 99, that are commonly found in human plasma. The TTR assay confirmed the activity of previously identified hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs and PBDEs, halogenated BPA and genistein. These results show that the hydroxylated metabolites of the ubiquitous PBDEs not only target the T4 transport at the TTR level, but also, and to a great extent, at the TBG level where most of the T4 in humans is circulating. The optimized SPR biosensor-based transport protein assay is a suitable method for high throughput screening of large libraries for potential thyroid hormone disrupting compounds.},

First, we analyzed correlations between log-transformed hepatic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels and probe signals detected in wild cormorant liver to screen contaminant-responsive genes. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using the screened probes. Third, these probes were divided into two groups based on our PCA result. Finally, we calculated Euclidian distance of signals, which is equivalent to variance of gene expressions, in each probe set, and analyzed the relationship between log-transformed hepatic TEQ levels and Euclidian distances. A probe set whereby the calculated Euclidian distance was positively correlated with TEQ levels, could indicate genes that were directly affected by dioxins or other persistent organic pollutants (POPs), hence they can be used as biomarkers. By contrast, there were a number of probes whereby the Euclidian distance was negatively correlated with TEQ levels. In the latter probe group, the smaller Euclidian distances in highly contaminated individuals could point to changes in physiological activities of wild cormorants. Therefore, our microarray data analysis method will provide new insights into POPs-responsive genes in field-collected samples for toxicogenomics studies.},

abstract = {An automated direct sample introduction technique coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (DSI-GC x GC/TOF-MS) was applied for the development of a relatively fast and easy analytical screening method for 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and 4 non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish oil. Comparison of instrumental performance between DSI-GC x GC/TOF-MS and the traditional gas chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometric (GC-HRMS) method showed good agreement of results for standard solutions analyzed in blind fashion. Relatively high tolerance of the DSI technique for lipids in the final extracts enabled a streamlined sample preparation procedure that only required gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) cleanup with graphitized carbon black. The sample size for the method was 2g of cod liver oil, which achieved limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 0.019-7.8 pg/g toxic equivalent quotients for the individual PCDD/Fs. Lower detection limits can be achieved by using larger sample size and scaling up the sample preparation procedure, but this adds to the labor, time, solvent consumption, and expense of the approach. However, the streamlined method yielded 0.94 pg/g and 2.3 pg/g LOQs for 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzofuran (TCDF) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachloro biphenyl (CB126), which were sufficiently low for regulatory monitoring of 2g samples. Therefore, instead of congener specific analysis, this streamlined analytical screening method for TCDF and CB126 has the potential to monitor fish oil contaminated with dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs at or above current food safety limits. Acceptable recoveries for nearly all analytes at three different spiking levels in fish oil samples were achieved with good repeatability.},

abstract = {A convenient analytical method for the simultaneous determination of more than 40 pharmaceuticals belonging to various therapeutic categories in whole blood has been developed. Exemplarily, the method was fully validated for eight different pharmaceuticals. The procedure entails addition of acetonitrile, magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride to a small amount of blood, then the mixture is shaken intensively and centrifuged for phase separation. An aliquot of the organic layer is cleaned up by dispersive solid-phase extraction employing bulk sorbents as well as magnesium sulfate for the removal of residual water. This method was based on the QuEChERS approach developed for pesticide residue analysis in food. Gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with electron (EI) and chemical (CI) ionisation was then used for qualitative and quantitative determination of the pharmaceuticals. The dispersive SPE with PSA (sorbent functionalized with primary and secondary amines) was found more suitable than aminopropyl and a styrene-divinylbenzene sorbent for sample clean-up before drug level determination in whole blood and plasma, as it was found that most of endogenous matrix components were removed and the analytes were isolated from spiked samples with recoveries above 80\%. Variation coefficients of the repeatability typically smaller than 10\% have been achieved for a wide range of the investigated substances. The used analytical conditions allowed to separate successively a variety of drugs and poisons with the typical limit of detection at <20 ng mL(-1) levels using 1 microL injection of equivalent blood sample in whole blood. The method is simple, rapid, cheap and very effective for therapeutic drug monitoring and forensic chemistry.},

abstract = {A sensitive and selective method utilizing high performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-LC/MS/MS) was developed to enable analysis of selected natural persistent organohalogens accumulated in marine biota. The analytes were three methoxylated tetrabromodiphenyl ethers (6-MeO-BDE47, 2'-MeO-BDE68, and 2',6-diMeO-BDE68), a dimethoxylated tetrabromobiphenyl (2,2'-diMeO-BB80), and two halogenated methyl bipyrroles (Cl(7)-MBP and Br(4)Cl(2)-DBP). These products were well resolved on a 150 mm reversed-phase column with methanol as the mobile phase. The fragmentation pathways of the Cl(7)-MBP and Br(4)Cl(2)-DBP produced characteristic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Determination was performed in the MRM mode using phenoxide ion [M-Br+O](-) and product Br(-) ions for MeO-BDE analogues, or the precursor [M-Cl+O](-) to Br(-) ion for Br(4)Cl(2)-DBP, and to C(4)NCl(4)(-) ion for Cl(7)-MBP. The APCI-LC/MS/MS method is acceptable for calibration of the linearity and repeatability of all products studied in the low ng/g (lipid weight) level and with similar sensitivity to the electron ionization (EI)-GC/MS method. The proposed method was applied for quantification of natural organohalogens accumulated in melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra) blubber (N = 15) in the Asia-Pacific Ocean. The concentration was positively correlated between different groups of compounds except for 2'-MeO-BDE68. The use of the analytical method based on negative ion APCI-LC/MS/MS would provide a new way for rapid monitoring of halogenated natural products from marine biota, such as sponges or algae.},

abstract = {Contrary to its lower brominated congeners, the flame retardant decabromodiphenylether (DecaBDE) is not banned by the decision 2005/717/EG of the European Union. But the question of the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of this second most used flame retardant worldwide becomes subject of more intense research. In the present study, we developed a microwave-assisted method for the extraction of DecaBDE from polymers. Owing to its main use in electrical and electronic appliances and according to the fire safety standard UL94 V-0, the extraction procedure was carried out for the model compounds polyethylene and polystyrene. Special emphasis has been given to an accurate optimization by an experimental response surface design. Quantification was performed by means of HPLC-DAD. In order to achieve comparable data, extraction was also performed with classic Soxhlet extraction. To compare these results with an independent technique, microwave-induced oxygen combustion and ion chromatography complete this study.},

abstract = {The presence of a wide variety of organic pollutants with different physicochemical characteristics has been investigated in wastewater samples from a municipal solid-waste-treatment plant in Castell\'{o}n, Spain. An advanced analytical strategy was applied--combined used of two powerful and complementary techniques, GC and LC, both hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry with triple-quadrupole analyzers. The GC-MS-MS method was based on sample extraction using C(18) SPE cartridges and enabled the determination of approximately 60 compounds from different chemical families, for example PAHs, octyl/nonylphenols, PCBs, organochlorine compounds, insecticides, herbicides, and PBDEs. Most of the compounds selected are included as priority contaminants in the European Union (EU) Water Directive. The UHPLC-MS-MS method, which provided high chromatographic resolution and sensitivity and short analysis time, used sample extraction with Oasis HLB SPE cartridges and enabled the determination of 37 (more polar) pesticides. The methodology developed was applied to the analysis of 41 water samples (20 untreated raw leachates and 21 treated samples) collected between March 2007 and February 2009. Amounts of the contaminants investigated rarely exceeded 0.5 microg L(-1) in the treated (reverse osmosis) water samples analyzed. As expected, in untreated leachates the number of compounds detected and the concentrations found were notably higher than in treated waters. The most commonly detected pollutants were herbicides (simazine, terbuthylazine, terbutryn, terbumeton, terbacil, and diuron), fungicides (thiabendazole and carbendazim), and 4-t-octylphenol. The results obtained proved that use of reverse osmosis for water treatment was efficient and notably reduced the amounts of organic contaminants found in raw leachate samples. In order to investigate the presence of other non-target contaminants, water samples were also analyzed by using GC-TOF MS and LC-QTOF MS. Several organic pollutants that did not form a part of the previous list of target contaminants were identified in the samples, because of the high sensitivity of TOF MS in full-spectrum acquisition mode and the valuable accurate-mass information provided by these instruments. The insecticide diazinon, the fungicide diphenylamide, the UV filter benzophenone, N-butylbenzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA), the insect repellent diethyltoluamide, caffeine, and the pharmaceuticals erythromycin, benzenesulfonanilide, ibuprofen, atenolol, and paracetamol were some of the compounds identified in the water samples analyzed.},

abstract = {A liquid nitrogen jet-cooled thermal modulator dedicated to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography has been mounted in a GC oven coupled to a high resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometry instrument. The data acquisition parameters of the slow double-focusing magnetic sector MS instrument have been optimized to accommodate the description of the narrow modulated GC peaks. Acquisition rates were increased to 20Hz, while maintaining high mass resolution. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) descriptors, typically including several ions for both native and labeled analytes, were thus reduced to one or two to ensure enough MS cycle time. For maximization of the sensitivity enhancement due to cryogenic zone compression (CZC), the entire GC peak of interest was trapped and remobilized in one event. Optimization of the method resulted in the ability to detect low attogram (ag) amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) (313ag gives a S/N of 400:1), a level that had not yet been attained using classical GC-HRMS. An isotope-dilution calibration curve was constructed using (13)C(12)-2,3,7,8-TCDD as the internal standard over the range of 500ag/$\mu$L to 35,000ag/$\mu$L (R(2)=0.9953). Analyses of a standard natural human reference serum-matrix NIST SRM 1589a containing 223ag of 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD) (70\% recovery rate assumed) resulted in a peak with a S/N of 188:1 (4 sigma, m/z=355.8546). Measurement of 2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl-1,1,1-trichloroethane) (DDE) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) in human dried-blood spot (DBS) samples is also reported to illustrate the usefulness of such a sensitive technique. Finally, some of the challenges related to sample preparation, blank levels, and to the fact of measuring of such a limited number of molecules (less than 600,000 TCDD molecules) are discussed.},

abstract = {The potential of ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) for the screening and confirmation of antibiotics in water samples is illustrated in this paper. UHPLC presents several advantages over conventional liquid chromatography as it generates narrow peaks (increasing peak height and improving sensitivity) and reduces chromatographic runs. Regarding QTOF-MS, its increased mass resolution, high sensitivity in full-spectrum acquisition mode and mass accuracy, in both MS and MS/MS modes, make this technique ideal for the detection and reliable confirmation of organic contaminants in environmental samples. After a solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges, UHPLC-QTOF-MS has been applied in this work to several types of water samples (surface water and influent and effluent wastewaters). Several antibiotics were found in the samples, such as ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarythromycin or erythromycin, among others. Moreover, the full spectrum data provided by TOF-MS acquisition has enabled searching for many other pharmaceuticals that could be present in the samples in a "post-target" way. This approach has allowed the detection and confirmation of paracetamol, omeprazole and codeine, among others. UPLC-QTOF-MS has been shown as an attractive and efficient hyphenated technique for the rapid detection and confirmation of pharmaceuticals in water with very little sample handling.},

abstract = {A novel peak alignment algorithm using a distance and spectrum correlation optimization (DISCO) method has been developed for two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOF-MS)-based metabolomics. This algorithm uses the output of the instrument control software, ChromaTOF, as its input data. It detects and merges multiple peak entries of the same metabolite into one peak entry in each input peak list. After a z-score transformation of metabolite retention times, DISCO selects landmark peaks from all samples based on both two-dimensional retention times and mass spectrum similarity of fragment ions measured by Pearson's correlation coefficient. A local linear fitting method is employed in the original two-dimensional retention time space to correct retention time shifts. A progressive retention time map searching method is used to align metabolite peaks in all samples together based on optimization of the Euclidean distance and mass spectrum similarity. The effectiveness of the DISCO algorithm is demonstrated using data sets acquired under different experiment conditions and a spiked-in experiment.},

We developed a database of 3193 pharmaceuticals from two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases and some lists of top ranked or selling drugs. Of the 3193 pharmaceuticals, 275 pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment and 399 pharmaceuticals were, based upon production volumes, designated as high production volume (HPV) pharmaceuticals. All pharmaceuticals that had reported chemical structures were evaluated for potential bioaccumulation (B) or persistence (P) using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) or scientific judgment. Of the 275 drugs detected in the environment, 92 were rated as potentially bioaccumulative, 121 were rated as potentially persistent, and 99 were HPV pharmaceuticals. After removing the 275 pharmaceuticals previously detected in the environment, 58 HPV compounds were identified that were both P\&B and 48 were identified as P only. Of the non-HPV compounds, 364 pharmaceuticals were identified that were P\&B. This study has yielded some interesting and probable P\&B pharmaceuticals that should be considered for further study.},

abstract = {Perchlorate can competitively inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid gland (TG) via the sodium/iodide symporter, consequently reducing the production of thyroid hormones (THs). Until recently, the effects of perchlorate on TH homeostasis are being examined through measurement of serum levels of TH, by immunoassay (IA)-based methods. IA methods are fast, but for TH analysis, they are compromised by the lack of adequate specificity. Therefore, selective and sensitive methods for the analysis of THs in TG are needed, for assessment of the effects of perchlorate on TH homeostasis. In this study, we developed a method for the analysis of six THs: L-thyroxine (T(4)), 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)), 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine (rT(3)), 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,5-T(2)), 3,3'-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,3'-T(2)), and 3-iodo-L-thyronine (3-T(1)) in TG, using liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). TGs used in this study were from rats that had been placed on either iodide-deficient diet or iodide-sufficient diet, and that had either been provided with perchlorate in drinking water (10 mg/kg/day) or control water. TGs were extracted by pronase digestion and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The instrumental calibration range for each TH ranged from 1 to 200 ng/ml and showed a high linearity (r>0.99). The method quantification limits (LOQs) were determined to be 0.25 ng/mg TG for 3-T(1); 0.33 ng/mg TG for 3,3'- and 3,5-T(2); and 0.52 ng/mg TG for rT(3), T(3), and T(4). Rats were placed on an iodide-deficient or -sufficient diet for 2.5 months, and for the last 2 weeks of that period were provided either perchlorate (10 mg/kg/day) in drinking water or control water. Iodide deficiency and perchlorate administration both reduced TG stores of rT(3), T(3), and T(4). In iodide-deficient rats, perchlorate exacerbated the reduction in levels of THs in TG. With the advances in analytical methodology, the use of LC-MS/MS for measurement of hormone levels in TG will allow more comprehensive evaluations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.},

abstract = {Measurement of steroid esters in bovine hair samples, using sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), provides a powerful tool for identifying animals treated illicitly with growth promoters. The successful application of such testing requires appropriate sampling of hair from treated animals. This paper describes the results of hair analysis by LC-MS/MS for two animal studies in which animals were treated with estradiol-3-benzoate and nortestosterone decanoate. The results from the first animal study indicate that animals treated with these anabolic steroids may not always be identified from analysis of hair samples; positive test results occur sporadically and only for some of the treated animals. The results from the second animal study identify conditions attaching to positive hair samples, such as, that concentrations of steroid esters in hair are related to distance of sampling from point of injection and to time post-treatment, that concentrations of steroid esters in hair are related to dose given to the animal but that this relationship may vary over time post-treatment, and that steroid esters may be measured in regrowth hair taken some weeks after treatment. Steroid esters are determined along the length of the hair, confirming that accumulation of steroid esters into hair occurs from various sources, including blood, sweat and sebum. The reported research provides some useful insights into the mechanisms governing the persistence of steroid esters in bovine hair following illicit treatment with growth promoters.},

The drift tube consists of eight regions, four curved drift tubes and four ion funnels. Packets of ions are propagated around the drift tube by changing the drift field at a frequency that is resonant with the ion's drift time through each region. The approach trims each packet of ions as it leaves and enters each new region. An electrostatic gate allows ions to be kept in the drift tube for numerous cycles, increasing the ability to resolve specified ions. We demonstrate the approach by isolating the [M + 2H](2+) or [M + 3H](3+) charge state of substance P as well as individual trisaccharide isomers from a mixture of melezitose and raffinose. Resolving powers in excess of 300 are obtainable with this approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use a quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) method to predict the retention times of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). We analyse the GC×GC retention data taken from the literature by comparing predictive capability of different regression methods. The various models are generated using 70 out of 209 PCB congeners in the calibration stage, while their predictive performance is evaluated on the remaining 139 compounds. The two-dimensional chromatogram is initially estimated by separately modelling retention times of PCBs in the first and in the second column ((1) t (R) and (2) t (R), respectively). In particular, multilinear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) variable selection is performed to extract two small subsets of predictors for (1) t (R) and (2) t (R) from a large set of theoretical molecular descriptors provided by the popular software Dragon, which after removal of highly correlated or almost constant variables consists of 237 structure-related quantities. Based on GA-MLR analysis, a four-dimensional and a five-dimensional relationship modelling (1) t (R) and (2) t (R), respectively, are identified. Single-response partial least square (PLS-1) regression is alternatively applied to independently model (1) t (R) and (2) t (R) without the need for preliminary GA variable selection. Further, we explore the possibility of predicting the two-dimensional chromatogram of PCBs in a single calibration procedure by using a two-response PLS (PLS-2) model or a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) with two output neurons. In the first case, regression is carried out on the full set of 237 descriptors, while the variables previously selected by GA-MLR are initially considered as ANN inputs and subjected to a sensitivity analysis to remove the redundant ones. Results show PLS-1 regression exhibits a noticeably better descriptive and predictive performance than the other investigated approaches. The observed values of determination coefficients for (1) t (R) and (2) t (R) in calibration (0.9999 and 0.9993, respectively) and prediction (0.9987 and 0.9793, respectively) provided by PLS-1 demonstrate that GC×GC behaviour of PCBs is properly modelled. In particular, the predicted two-dimensional GC×GC chromatogram of 139 PCBs not involved in the calibration stage closely resembles the experimental one. Based on the above lines of evidence, the proposed approach ensures accurate simulation of the whole GC×GC chromatogram of PCBs using experimental determination of only 1/3 retention data of representative congeners.},

Parameters studied during method development included a dispersive SPE cleanup step after GPC, large volume injection into the GC system and the GC x GC separation. Qualitative and quantitative performance of the GC x GC system was evaluated by analyzing spiked extracts in the range equivalent to 1-100 microg/kg in feed. At levels of 50 microg/kg and higher, all compounds targeted for could be identified fully automatically by the software based on their mass spectra. At lower levels the hit rate decreased with the concentration. System linearity was excellent in solvent and only slightly affected by matrix (correlation coefficients r>or=0.995 for 90\% of the compounds). Limits of quantification were in the 1-20 microg/kg range for most compounds. The overall method was validated for 106 compounds at the 10 and 100 microg/kg level. Recoveries between 70\% and 110\% and RSDs below 20\% were obtained for the majority of the compounds.},

abstract = {Cultural heritage represents a bridge between the contemporary society and the past populations, and a strong collaboration between archaeologists, art historians and analysts may lead to the decryption of the information hidden in an ancient object. Quantitative elemental compositional data play a key role in solving questions concerning dating, provenance, technology, use and the relationship of ancient cultures with the environment. Nevertheless, the scientific investigation of an artifact should be carried out complying with some important constraints: above all the analyses should be as little destructive as possible and performed directly on the object to preserve its integrity. Laser ablation sampling coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) fulfils these requirements exhibiting comparably strong analytical performance in trace element determination. This review intends to show through the applications found in the literature how valuable is the contribution of LA-ICP-MS in the investigation of ancient materials such as obsidian, glass, pottery, human remains, written heritage, metal objects and miscellaneous stone materials. The main issues related to cultural heritage investigation are introduced, followed by a brief description of the features of this technique. An overview of the exploitation of LA-ICP-MS is then presented. Finally, advantages and drawbacks of this technique are critically discussed: the fit for purpose and prospects of the use of LA-ICP-MS are presented.},

abstract = {The quantification of differences between two or more physiological states of a biological system is among the most important but also most challenging technical tasks in proteomics. In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly. In this review, we critically examine the more commonly used quantitative mass spectrometry methods for their individual merits and discuss challenges in arriving at meaningful interpretations of quantitative proteomic data.},

The influence of several extraction experimental factors, temperature, pressure, duration and number of cycles, related to the PLE was investigated by an original and efficient chemometric approach. The optimised extraction method (80 degrees C, 40 bar, 10 min, 1 cycle) exhibited recoveries between 67 and 127\% with RSD mostly under 13\%.

abstract = {Environmental chemists have been challenged for over 30 years to analyse complex mixtures of halogenated organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated furans (PCDD/Fs). Gas chromatography (GC) often proved to be the method of choice because of its high resolution. The recent developments in the field of comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GCxGC) show that this technique can provide much more information than conventional (single-column) GC. Large volume injection (e.g. by programmed temperature vaporiser, or on-column injection) can be employed for the injection of tens of microliters of sample extract, in that way substantially improving the detection limits. Electron-capture detection (ECD) is a sensitive detection method but unambiguous identification is not possible and misidentification easily occurs. Mass spectrometric (MS) detection substantially improves the identification and the better the resolution (as with MS/MS, time-of-flight (TOF) MS and high-resolution (HR)MS), the lower the chances of misidentification are. Unfortunately, this comes only with substantially higher investments and maintenance costs. Co-extracted lipids, sulphur and other interferences can disturb the GC separation and detection leading to unreliable results. Extraction, and more so, sample clean-up and fractionation, are crucial steps prior to the GC analysis of these pollutants. Recent developments in sample extraction and clean-up show that selective pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) is an effective and efficient extraction and clean-up technique that enables processing of multiple samples in less than 1h. Quality assurance tools such as interlaboratory studies and reference materials are very well established for PCDD/Fs and PCBs but the improvement of that infrastructure is needed for brominated flame retardants, PCAs and toxaphene.},

abstract = {The orthogonality of three columns coupled in two series was studied for the congener specific comprehensive two-dimensional GC separation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A non-polar capillary column coated with poly(5\%-phenyl-95\%-methyl)siloxane was used as the first ((1)D) column in both series. A polar capillary column coated with 70\% cyanopropyl-polysilphenylene-siloxane or a capillary column coated with the ionic liquid 1,12-di(tripropylphosphonium)dodecane bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide were used as the second ((2)D) columns. Nine multi-congener standard PCB solutions containing subsets of all native 209 PCBs, a mixture of 209 PCBs as well as Aroclor 1242 and 1260 formulations were used to study the orthogonality of both column series. Retention times of the corresponding PCB congeners on (1)D and (2)D columns were used to construct retention time dependences (apex plots) for assessing orthogonality of both columns coupled in series. For a visual assessment of the peak density of PCBs congeners on a retention plane, 2D images were compared. The degree of orthogonality of both column series was, along the visual assessment of distribution of PCBs on the retention plane, evaluated also by Pearson's correlation coefficient, which was found by correlation of retention times t(R,i,2D) and t(R,i,1D) of corresponding PCB congeners on both column series. It was demonstrated that the apolar+ionic liquid column series is almost orthogonal both for the 2D separation of PCBs present in Aroclor 1242 and 1260 formulations as well as for the separation of all of 209 PCBs. All toxic, dioxin-like PCBs, with the exception of PCB 118 that overlaps with PCB 106, were resolved by the apolar/ionic liquid series while on the apolar/polar column series three toxic PCBs overlapped (105+127, 81+148 and 118+106).},

abstract = {This article reviews recent literature on the analysis of industrial contaminants in indoor air in the framework of the REACH project, which is mainly intended to improve protection of human health and the environment from the risks of more than 34 millions of chemical substances. Industrial pollutants that can be found in indoor air may be of very different types and origin, belonging to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) categories. Several compounds have been classified into the priority organic pollutants (POPs) class such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/PCDFs) and related polychlorinated compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Many of these compounds are partially associated to the air gas phase, but also to the suspended particulate matter. Furthermore, settled dust can act as a concentrator for the less volatile pollutants and has become a matrix of great concern for indoors contamination. Main literature considered in this review are papers from the last 10 years reporting analytical developments and applications regarding VOCs, aldehydes and other carbonyls, PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, and PAHs in the indoor environment. Sample collection and pretreatment, analyte extraction, clean-up procedures, determination techniques, performance results, as well as compound concentrations in indoor samples, are summarized and discussed. Emergent contaminants and pesticides related to the industrial development that can be found in indoor air are reviewed in a second part in this volume.},

abstract = {In this study we developed a GC-MS method for the analysis of priority pollutants, personal care products (PCPs) and other emerging contaminants in waters using large volume injection with backflushing. Analyses are performed in the SIM/scan mode, so that in addition to the targeted organic contaminants, this method allows the simultaneous screening of non-target compounds. The scan data are analysed using Deconvolution Reporting Software (DRS) which screens the results for 934 organic contaminants. Deconvolution helps identify contaminants that are buried in the chromatogram by co-extracted materials and significantly reduces chromatographic resolution requirements, allowing shorter analysis times. All compounds have locked retention times and we can continually update and extend the mass spectral library including new compounds. Linearity and limits of detection in SIM and full-scan mode were studied. Method detection limits (MDLs) in effluent wastewater ranged in most of the cases from 1 to 36 ng/L in SIM mode and from 4 to 66 ng/L in full-scan mode; while in river water from 0.4 to 14 and 2-29 ng/L in SIM and full-scan mode, respectively. We obtained a linearity of the calibration curves over two orders of magnitude. The method has been applied to the screening of a large number of organic contaminants--not only to a subset of targets--in urban wastewaters from different wastewater treatment plants and also in river waters. Most of the target compounds were detected at concentration levels ranging from 11 to 8697 ng/L and from 7 to 1861 ng/L in effluent wastewater and river waters, respectively. Additionally, a group of 12 new compounds were automatically identified using the AMDIS and NIST libraries. Other compounds, such as the 4-amino musk xylene, a synthetic fragrance metabolite, which was not included in the databases, but has been manually searched in the full-scan chromatograms.},

abstract = {Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is found globally as an environmental contaminant and is highly bioaccumulative in exposed biota including humans. However, there is a dearth of environmental information on the isomeric profile of PFOS, especially in biological samples, which requires suitable analysis methods for the identification and quantification of ultratrace amounts. In the present study, a novel method was developed that incorporates clean up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) WAX cartridges and in-port derivatization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify and quantitatively determine linear PFOS (L-PFOS) and branched (monotrifluoromethyl and bistrifluoromethyl) isomers in PFOS technical product and in environmentally relevant biological samples. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) was used for derivatization via an in situ pyrolytic alkylation reaction that occurred in the GC injector and generated butyl PFOS isomer derivatives. In addition to L-PFOS, ten branched PFOS isomers were identified in the technical product. The environmental relevance of branched PFOS isomers in addition to L-PFOS was evidenced by the presence of six branched and L-PFOS in representative herring gull and double-crested cormorant egg, and polar bear liver and plasma samples from the Great Lakes and Arctic, respectively. For all PFOS isomers in the technical product and biota samples the method demonstrated high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL, with exception of L-PFOS where the LOD was 1.46 ng/mL. For the biotic samples, the method detection limits (MDLs) were slightly higher than the LODs and ranged from 0.09 to 0.46 ng/g wet weight (w.w.) with exception of L-PFOS (MDL = 6.87 ng/g w.w.).},

abstract = {Thermal extraction-GC-MS (TE-GC-MS) is a relatively new analytical technique which demonstrates a large potential for the analysis of various solid matrices. This technique provides a rapid quantitative and simultaneous determination of a wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds without laborious sample preparation or any chemical pre-treatment. Its amenability to automation and coupling with on-line detection methods makes TE-GC-MS a promising technique, not only in laboratory analysis, but also for in situ emission monitoring. However, the number of studies dedicated to the application of TE-GC-MS to fly ashes, which are an unavoidable by-product of any thermal industrial process and also the sink of many environmental pollutants, is limited. The ability of TE-GC-MS to analyse a wide range of trace semi-volatile dioxin surrogate compounds in fly ash samples is investigated as an alternative to the well-established solvent extraction-GC-MS analysis (SE-GC-MS). Reproducibility, the effect of TE temperature, time, flow, and the influence of the analysed matrix are studied. Dedicated experiments demonstrate that the conversion (dechlorination and in situ formation) of target analytes and the decomposition of the fly ash matrix can take place at elevated TE temperatures and during prolonged TE times. Moreover, these effects are matrix-specific and vary from sample to sample. After optimizing the TE parameters, two fly ash samples of different origins are analysed and more than 50 individual analytes representing different classes of aromatic compounds are quantified and compared with those available from the SE-GC-MS analysis.},

abstract = {Their characteristics as persistent organic pollutant and their toxicity (2,3,7,8-TCDD is named as a known human carcinogen) make the dioxins and related compounds a focus of interest in environmental analytical chemistry. In view of the widespread distribution of dioxins in the environment, these compounds must be monitored in several matrices, such as air, effluents, soil, sludge and biological samples. The analytical methodologies are especially difficult owing to the complexity of the mixtures of congeners (210 PCDD/Fs and 209 PCBs) and to the low detection limits required (ppb to ppq). Moreover, time-consuming sample preparation steps are needed owing to the presence of a large number of interfering compounds. The different toxicity of each congener requires the development of congener specific methods. This review of trace dioxin determination by mass spectrometry (MS) includes sample preparation and chromatographic separation. In this Special Feature, the use of different MS techniques such as low-resolution MS (LRMS) and high-resolution MS (HRMS) is discussed in terms of selectivity and sensitivity. The performances of other MS techniques, such as tandem MS (MS/MS) and time-of-flight MS (ToFMS), are compared. Quantification techniques, especially the isotopic dilution method, are also discussed.

The target analytes included phenols (nitrophenols, chlorophenols, bromophenols and alkylphenols), acidic herbicides (phenoxy acids and dicamba) and several pharmaceuticals. Experimental variables affecting derivatisation yield and peak shape as a function of different experimental PTV parameters [initial injection time, pressure and temperature and the ratio solvent volume/N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) volume] were first optimised by an experimental design approach. Subsequently, SBSE conditions, such as pH, ionic strength, agitation speed and extraction time were investigated. After optimisation, the method failed only for the extraction of most polar phenols and some pharmaceuticals, being suitable for the determination of 37 (out of 46) pollutants, with detection limits for these analytes ranging between 1 and 800 ng/L and being lower than 25 ng/L in most cases. Finally, the developed method was validated and applied to the determination of target analytes in various aqueous environmental matrices, including ground, river and wastewater. Acceptable accuracy (70-130\%) and precision values (<20\%) were obtained for most analytes independently of the matrix, with the exception of some alkylphenols, where an isotopically labelled internal standard would be required in order to correct for matrix effects. Among the drawbacks of the method, carryover was identified as the main problem even though the Twisters were cleaned repeatedly.},

Separated analytes were ionized using an atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source equipped with a 10 eV krypton lamp and operated in negative ion mode. [M-Br + O](-) ions were monitored as precursor ions for all studied PBDEs, except for BDE-208 and BDE-209 which produced higher intensity at the [C(6)Br(5)O](-) ion cluster. [Br](-) ions were monitored as fragment ions for all target compounds. Method detection limits ranged from 12 to 30 pg. The method was applied to determination of PBDEs in standard reference material (SRM 2585), and favorable results were obtained. Unlike GC methods, no thermal degradation was encountered in the analysis of higher brominated PBDEs. This rendered the method useful for quantification of BDE-209 debromination products. The method also allows the use of (13)C-labeled internal standards, which compensate for instrumental fluctuations and matrix-related ion suppression or enhancement.},

abstract = {This paper describes the determination and quantitation of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) enantiomers by liquid chromatography-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS). The method is based on the use of a chiral chromatographic column Nucleodex beta-PM (200 mm x 4.0 mm, 5 microm), which allows a good separation between HBCD enantiomers [(+/-)alpha, (+/-)beta and (+/-)gamma] in less than 15 min and the detection is performed by a Q-Trap instrument. Linearity was checked between 0.05 and 25 injected ng. Limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.3-1.5 pg, limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 1 and 6 pg, and both values are lower than those published in the literature applying LC-MS-MS methods. The method was applied to sediment samples collected along the Cinca River, a tributary of the Ebro River (northeast of Spain). Samples were extracted and purified following a pressurized liquid extraction method. LODs of the method were between 0.12 and 5.61 ng/g and LOQs, from 0.38 to 1.87 ng/g. Total HBCD levels in these sediments ranged from not detected to 2660 ng/g dry weight. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs) were calculated and compared with EF obtained from standard injections. It is important to note that calculated EFs were corrected using (2)H(18)-labeled HBCD standards, in order to compensate matrix effect. EFs obtained in sediment samples suggested a higher presence of (+)alpha-HBCD and (+)gamma-HBCD in technical mixture, this suggests that it is not a racemic mixture.},

The quality of the separation and the number of resolved and coeluting peaks were compared to predictions according to the statistical overlap theory (SOT) and to literature data on PCB separations obtained by one-dimensional and comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC x GC) and GC-MS. Mass spectral and chemometric deconvolution procedures were used to resolve overlapping peaks. On the highly efficient column, 195 PCB congeners were resolved in 96 min separation time using spectral and chemometric deconvolution. This number is comparable to the best separations described in GC x GC-MS mode. The novel method was developed for spectral deconvolution of overlapped PCB congeners which was verified determining the most toxic, dioxin-like PCBs both in the model mixture of 209 PCBs as well as in the Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1254 formulations.},

abstract = {Serotonin is a major neurotransmitter and affects various functions both in the brain and in the rest of the body. It has been demonstrated that altered serotinergic function is implicated in various psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. Serotonin has also been implicated along with dopamine in attention deficit-hyperkinetic disorder (AD-HKD). This study provides a versatile validated method for the analysis of serotonin, hydroxyindole acetic acid and dopamine in urine using LC-MS/MS. This method was then used to quantify these analytes in a test group of 17 children diagnosed with severe AD-HKD. This group was compared to a matched control group to investigate the possibility that one of these compounds may be a potential biomarker for this condition. The developed method provided good linear calibration curves for the multiplex assay of analytes in urine (0.05-3.27 nmol/L; R (2) ≥ 0.9977). Acceptable inter-day repeatability was achieved for all analytes with RSD values (n = 9) ranging from 1.1\% to 9.3\% over a concentration range of 0.11-3.27 $\mu$mol/L in urine. Excellent limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ) were achieved with LODs of 8.8-18.2 nmol/L and the LOQs of 29.4-55.7 nmol/L for analytes in urine. Recoveries were in the ranges of 98-104\%, 100-106\% and 91-107\% for serotonin, 5-HIAA and dopamine, respectively. An appropriate sample clean-up procedure for urine was developed to ensure efficient recovery and reproducibility on analysis. Evaluation of matrix effects was also carried out and the influence of ion suppression on analytical results reported. Confirmatory analysis was carried out on a linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer to obtain high mass accuracy data of the target analytes in the clinical samples.},

The proposed methodology maximised separation of both within and among OB families, and among these and other halogenated micropollutants detected in these samples and co-extracted matrix components. Special attention has been paid to solve co-elution problems observed during the analysis of OBs with one-dimensional GC-based techniques. Satisfactory separation among several relevant PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs has been obtained allowing their unambiguous determination in a single run. Additional studies were conducted to identify selected NBFRs and HNPs. 2,4-Dibromoanisole, a dibromophenol isomer and hexabromobenzene were identified in the investigated samples. Several new tri- and tetra-BHD derivates were also identified, indicating that these compounds could apparently exist as structured families in nature. In addition, a tetrabrominated diMeO-biphenyl and two tetrabrominated diMeO-BDEs were also tentatively identified.},

In the present method, derivatization with dansyl chloride was employed, and all the derivertized target compounds were well resolved on a 100mm Xbridge C18 column with acetonitrile and 0.1\% formic acid as the mobile phases. Purification procedures, such as liquid-liquid extraction and silica-gel chromatography, were applied to reduce matrix effects in the sample extract and remove excess derivatizing reagents, thus permitting selective and sensitive detection of the target phenolic compounds. The limit of quantification for all analytes, with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10, was 2-30 pg/g (plasma weight) except for 6-OH-BDE-137 (30 pg/g) and 3-BRP (60 pg/g). The method was validated for recoveries (68-100\%), accuracy (84-110\%) and precision (3.7-11\%) using charcoal-stripped bovine blood plasma spiked with all target compounds (500 and 5000 pg/mL). Finally, the method was applied to analyze six blood plasma samples from frogs and cormorants, where two natural estrogens, one BPA, one OH-PBDE and four BRPs were detected. The greatest total concentrations of estrogens coincided with the least total concentrations of other phenolic compounds for both species. The proposed method based on derivatization followed by LC-MS/MS provides a novel method to simultaneously monitor multiple groups of phenolic compounds in blood plasma.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the determination of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) has been carried out by gas chromatography (GC). However, the gas chromatographic behavior and sensitivity of this type of hydroxylated compounds are not always satisfactory, hence a prior derivatization of the OH-PCBs must be performed. Therefore, the development of liquid chromatographic methods should prove to be a very interesting task aimed at dealing with the instrumental determination of OH-PCBs. Taking into account that octadecylsilane stationary phases are not the most adequate for the separation of isobaric compounds, an amide-type column has been tested. For the development of the method, the Response Surface Methodology was used, based on a Box-Wilson Central Composite experimental design. The initial content of methanol in the mobile phase, the gradient time, and the concentration and the pH value of the buffer were chosen as relevant experimental parameters. A global optimum was obtained by selecting the elution time, the sensitivity and the overall resolution as responses to optimize. The developed method for liquid chromatography presented a very good resolution and sensitivity, and a reasonably short analysis time. In addition, a retention study was conducted in order to survey the different interactions that take place in the separation process, showing that hydrogen bonding is the main interaction between OH-PCBs and the amide-type stationary phase. However, a substantial contribution of dispersion forces was present in methanol contents in the mobile phase below 65\%. Besides, the pH value of the mobile phase was found to be the most important parameter to control the hydrogen bond forces and therefore, to regulate the OH-PCBs separation.},

The trimeric complex ions are generated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and the ions undergo collisional activation to realize isomeric discrimination from the branching ratio of the two fragment pathways that form the dimeric complexes [M(II)(A)(ref*)-H](+) and [M(II)(ref*)(2)-H](+). The ratio of the individual branching ratios for the two isomers R(iso) is found strongly dependent on the references and the metal ions. Various sets are tried by choosing the reference from amino acids, substituted amino acids, and dipeptides in combination with the central metal ion chosen from five transition-metal ions (Co(II), Cu(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)) for the complexes in this experiment. The results are compared in terms of the isomeric discrimination for the T(3)/rT(3) pair. Calibration curves are constructed by relating the ratio of the branching ratios against the isomeric composition of their mixture to allow rapid quantitative isomer analysis of the sample pair. Furthermore, the instrument-dependence of this method is investigated by comparing the two sets of results, one obtained from a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer and the other from a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer.},

abstract = {A pulsed large-volume injection gas chromatography coupled with electron-capture negative ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (pLVI-GC/ECNI-qMS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of typical halogenated persistent organic pollutants (H-POPs). By monitoring the characteristic ions of large mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) for each of the H-POPs rather than the chlorine and/or bromine ions, this method avoided the possible interferences arising from the H-POPs themselves and from complex matrices encountered frequently in current GC/qMS methods; and allowed, on the other hand, the use of (13)C-labeled and perdeuterated analogues as internal standards for reliable quantification. pLVI up to 120 microL improved the instrumental detection limits down to pg-fg mL(-1), comparable to or lower than those obtained by the recognized GC/high-resolution MS methods reported so far. The H-POPs including 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 1 polybrominated biphenyl, 10 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 4 hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and hexachlorobenzene were involved in this study. The method developed demonstrated good linearity (r(2) = 0.9904-0.9999) within 0.5 to 50,000 pg mL(-1) for PCBs and 0.05 to 5000 pg mL(-1) for other H-POPs, and was satisfactory in terms of both repeatability (0.07\%-2.2\%) and reproducibility (2.1\%-8.4\%). It was validated by analyzing a NIST standard reference material SRM-1946 of Lake Superior fish tissue with low 0.01 to 63 pg g(-1) method detection limits, and successfully applied to the determination of the H-POPs in five reference materials of different matrices.},

abstract = {We report a new quantitative metabolome profiling technique based on differential (12)C-/(13)C-isotope dansylation labeling of metabolites, fast liquid chromatography (LC) separation and electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR MS) detection. An isotope reagent, (13)C-dansyl chloride, can be readily synthesized. This reagent, along with (12)C-dansyl chloride, provides a simple and robust means of labeling metabolites containing primary amine, secondary amine, or phenolic hydroxyl group(s). It is shown that dansylation labeling offers 1-3 orders of magnitude ESI signal enhancement over the underivatized counterparts. Dansylation alters the chromatographic behaviors of polar and ionic metabolites normally not retainable on a reversed phase (RP) column to an extent that they can be retained and separated by RPLC with high efficiency. There is no isotopic effect on RPLC separation of the differential isotope labeled metabolites, and (12)C-/(13)C-labeled isoforms of metabolites are coeluted and detected by MS for precise and accurate quantification and confident metabolite identification. It is demonstrated that, in the analysis of 20 amino acids, a linear response of over 2 orders of magnitude is achieved for relative metabolite quantification with an average relative standard deviation (RSD) of about 5.3\% from replicate experiments. A dansylation standard compound library consisting of 121 known amines and phenols has been constructed and is proven to be useful for absolute metabolite quantification and MS-based metabolite identification in biological samples. As an example, the absolute concentrations of 93 metabolites, ranging from 30 nM to 2510 microM, can be determined from a pooled sample of human urines collected in 5 consecutive days labeled with (12)C-dansylation and spiked with the 121 (13)C-dansylated standards. Relative concentration variations of these metabolites in individual urine samples can also be monitored by mixing the (13)C-dansylated pooled urine sample with the (12)C-dansylated individual sample. With a 12 min fast LC separation combined with FTICR MS, 672 metabolites were detected in a human urine sample with each metabolite peak having a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 20; the identities of most of the metabolites remain to be determined. This work illustrates that dansylation labeling and fast LC/FTICR MS can be a powerful technique for quantitative profiling of at least 672 metabolites in urine samples in 12 min.},

abstract = {Research into the analysis and monitoring of steroidal estrogens has grown significantly over the last decade, resulting in the emergence of a range of applicable techniques. In this study, three popular techniques, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) for the analysis of three highly potent steroidal estrogens in the aquatic environment have been compared. It has been observed that overall, the three techniques appear comparable in generating similar estrogen concentrations for river and effluent samples. Of the three techniques, the GC-MS technique is the simplest to operate, but fails to detect the estrogens at the lower-end of environmentally relevant concentrations. The tandem MS techniques are more selective than MS, and therefore able to detect lower concentration levels of the three steroidal estrogens of interest. However, the LC-MS-MS technique is more susceptible to matrix interferences for the analysis of samples, resulting in a reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio and a subsequent reduction in reliability and stability compared to GC-MS-MS. With the GC-MS-MS technique offering increased selectivity, the lowest limits of detection, and no false positive identification, it is recommended to be the preferred analytical technique for routine analysis of estrogens in environmental water samples.},

Using the post-column dilution of the LC eluent by water and subsequent extraction with the needle interface, the analyte was successfully concentrated to the PDMS phase on the fibrous support in the needle. The concentrated analytes were directly injected to GC system by inserting the needle to a heated GC injector. 2D separations of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and also kerosene-extract were performed with the off-line RPLC-GC system interfaced by the needle extractor. The results suggested that the fiber-packed needle interface could be one of the simple and effective approaches to develop an on-line coupled LC-GC system.},

abstract = {A specific and sensitive method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LC-APCI-MS/MS) has been developed for the determination of gestagens in kidney fat (medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate and melengestrol acetate). The procedure involved a clean-up procedure with gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The analytes were analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS/MS, in positive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two diagnostic product ions from the chosen precursor for the unambiguous confirmation of the gestagens. The method was validated at the validation level of 1.0 ng/g. The accuracy and precision of the method were satisfactory. The decision limits CCalpha ranged from 0.20 to 0.22 ng/g while the detection capabilities CCbeta ranged from 0.33 to 0.38 ng/g. The method proved to be sensitive and reliable and thus renders an appropriate mean for residue analysis studies.},

We tested constraints for reidentifying the correct structures of 29 known metabolite peaks from GCT premier accurate mass chemical ionization GC-TOF mass spectrometry data without any use of mass spectral libraries. Correct elemental formulas were retrieved within the top-3 hits for most molecular ion adducts using the "Seven Golden Rules" algorithm. An average of 514 potential structures per formula was downloaded from the PubChem chemical database and in-silico-derivatized using the ChemAxon software package. After chemical curation, Kovats retention indices (RI) were predicted for up to 747 potential structures per formula using the NIST MS group contribution algorithm and corrected for contribution of trimethylsilyl groups using the Fiehnlib RI library. When matching the range of predicted RI values against the experimentally determined peak retention, all but three incorrect formulas were excluded. For all remaining isomeric structures, accurate mass electron ionization spectra were predicted using the MassFrontier software and scored against experimental spectra. Using a mass error window of 10 ppm for fragment ions, 89\% of all isomeric structures were removed and the correct structure was reported in 73\% within the top-5 hits of the cases.},

We compared five methods for extracting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organochlorine pesticides, and lipids from serum using National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in Human Serum. Liquid:liquid (LLE), cavity-dispersed microwave-assisted (MAE), focused microwave-assisted (FME), solid-phase (SPE), and pressurized fluid (PFE) extraction techniques were compared. FME extraction yielded the optimal recovery of internal standards (IS). All methods resulted in similar contaminant concentrations that also agreed with the certified values for SRM 1589a, except for only a few compounds measured by methods other than FME. Based on these findings, the FME method was determined to be the best overall extraction method. One procedural factor was found to affect contaminant concentrations; use of IS carrier solvents that were immiscible with serum (or when the serum was not directly physically mixed with IS) resulted in a 30\% underestimation of organohalogen concentrations. This study offers valid, novel extraction alternatives beyond traditional methods (e.g., LLE) for blood contaminant measurements.},

abstract = {A method for the determination of underivatized amino acids based on capillary electrophoresis coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) is described. To analyze free amino acids simultaneously a low acidic pH condition was used to confer positive charge on whole amino acids. The choice of the electrolyte and its concentration influenced resolution and peak shape of the amino acids, and 1 M formic acid was selected as the optimal electrolyte. Meanwhile, the sheath liquid composition had a significant effect on sensitivity and the highest sensitivity was obtained when 5 mM ammonium acetate in 50\% (v/v) methanol-water was used. Protonated amino acids were roughly separated by CE and selectively detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a sheath flow electrospray ionization interface. Under the optimized conditions, 19 free amino acids normally found in proteins and several physiological amino acids were well determined in less than 17 min. The detection limits for basic amino acids were between 0.3 and 1.1 mumol/L and for acidic and low molecular weight amino acids were less than 6.0 mumol/L with pressure injection of 50 mbar for 3 s (3 nL) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. This method is simple, rapid, and selective compared with conventional techniques and could be readily applied to the analysis of free amino acids in soy sauce.},

abstract = {Large-scale proteomic and metabolomic technologies are increasingly gaining attention for their use in the diagnosis of human disease. In order to ensure the statistical power of relevant markers, such analyses must incorporate a large number of representative samples. While in a best-case scenario these samples are collected through a study design that is specifically tailored for the desired analysis, often studies must rely upon the analysis of large numbers of previously banked samples that may or may not have complete and accurate documentation of their associated collection and storage methods. In this study, several human blood matrices were analyzed and compared for the quality of metabolomic output. The sample types that were tested include plasma prepared with a variety of anticoagulants and serum collected by venipuncture and capillary blood collection protocols. Analysis with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed only subtle differences between the various plasma preparation methods. Differences between the serum and plasma samples appear to be largely peptide/protein-based and are consistent with the biological distinction of the two matrices. Interestingly, the small molecule lysophosphatidylinositol was found to be in higher abundance in plasma, as a possible consequence of the effect of the intrinsic clotting cascade on adjacent metabolic pathways. Comparison of the small-molecule profiles of the capillary- and venipuncture-collected samples revealed 23 statistically significant compound differences between these sample types. Most of these features can be attributed to surfactants and detergents used to pretreat the skin in order to maintain the sterility of sample collection. However, several have identical mass and molecular formulas as endogenous human metabolites and could be erroneously attributed to actual metabolic perturbations. Understanding the extent of these matrix effects is important for control of systematic bias and ensuring the quality of metabolomic analysis.},

abstract = {Human activities are releasing gigatonnes of carbon to the Earth's atmosphere annually. Direct consequences of cumulative post-industrial emissions include increasing global temperature, perturbed regional weather patterns, rising sea levels, acidifying oceans, changed nutrient loads and altered ocean circulation. These and other physical consequences are affecting marine biological processes from genes to ecosystems, over scales from rock pools to ocean basins, impacting ecosystem services and threatening human food security. The rates of physical change are unprecedented in some cases. Biological change is likely to be commensurately quick, although the resistance and resilience of organisms and ecosystems is highly variable. Biological changes founded in physiological response manifest as species range-changes, invasions and extinctions, and ecosystem regime shifts. Given the essential roles that oceans play in planetary function and provision of human sustenance, the grand challenge is to intervene before more tipping points are passed and marine ecosystems follow less-buffered terrestrial systems further down a spiral of decline. Although ocean bioengineering may alleviate change, this is not without risk. The principal brake to climate change remains reduced CO(2) emissions that marine scientists and custodians of the marine environment can lobby for and contribute to. This review describes present-day climate change, setting it in context with historical change, considers consequences of climate change for marine biological processes now and in to the future, and discusses contributions that marine systems could play in mitigating the impacts of global climate change.},

There is very little evidence of the fishery reducing availability of sandeels to breeding seabirds, but there is concern that fishery managers should take account of the needs of breeding seabirds. Here we present a quantitative index of the sensitivity of different seabird species' breeding success to reduced abundance of sandeels. The index is based on seabird size, cost of foraging, potential foraging range, ability to dive, amount of 'spare' time in the daily budget, and ability to switch diet. Testing the index with empirical data from Shetland during periods of reduced sandeel abundance shows a close correlation between seabird breeding performance and predictions from the index. Mapping the distributions around the North Sea of seabirds with breeding success highly sensitive to sandeel abundance shows that the majority of sensitive seabirds breed in Shetland and Orkney. industrial fishing in those regions should be closely controlled to avoid depleting the local sandeel stocks on which seabirds depend. This analysis considers only impacts on seabird breeding. There is a need for analysis of possible influences on other aspects of seabird demography.},

abstract = {In this review we detail the impact of climate change on marine productivity, on marine environmental stochasticity and cyclicity, and on the spatio-temporal match-mismatch of seabirds and their prey. We thereby show that global warming has a profound bottom-up impact upon marine top-predators, but that such effects have to be studied in conjunction with the (top-down) impact of human fisheries upon seabird food resources. Further, we propose seabird ecological features, such as memory effects and social constraints, that make them particularly sensitive to rapid environmental change. We provide examples of how seabirds may nonetheless adapt when facing the consequences of climate change. We conclude that our understanding of the spatial ecology of seabirds facing environmental change is still rudimentary, despite its relevance for the conservation of these vulnerable organisms and for the management of marine ecosystems. We define the following research priorities. (1) Determine the factors affecting seabird distribution and movements at sea using biotelemetry, as well as colony dynamics on land. (2) Link seabird distribution patterns to those of their prey, (3) Determine further the role of historical and metapopulation processes in contributing to the dynamics of the spatial distribution of seabirds. (4) Assess phenotypic plasticity and the potential for microevolution within seabird spatial responses to climate change, since both will greatly affect the quality of modelling studies. (5) Adapt existing models to define and predict the impact of climate change onto seabird spatial dynamics. (6) Synthesize all gathered information to define marine protected areas and further conservation schemes, such as capacity reduction of fisheries. This research effort will require maintaining existing long-term monitoring programmes for seabirds, as well as developing new approaches to permit the integration of processes occurring at various scales, in order to be able to fully track the population responses of these long-lived vertebrates to environmental changes.},

abstract = {Determining how climate fluctuations affect ocean ecosystems requires an understanding of how biological and physical processes interact across a wide range of scales. Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1oC over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95\% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century.},

abstract = {Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a biogenic compound produced in sea-surface water and outgased to the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, DMS is a significant source of cloud condensation nuclei in the unpolluted marine atmosphere. It has been postulated that climate may be partly modulated by variations in DMS production through a DMS-cloud condensation nuclei-albedo feedback. We present here a modelled estimation of the reponse of DMS sea-water concentrations and DMS fluxes to climate change, following previous work on marine DMS modeling (Aumont et al.. 2002) and on the global warming impact on marine biology (Bopp et al.. 2001). An atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (GCM) was coupled to a marine biogeochemical scheme and used without flux correction to simulate climate response to increased greenhouse gases (a 1\% increase per year in atmospheric CO2 until it has doubled). The predicted global distribution of DMS at I x CO2 compares reasonably well with observations: however, in the high latitudes, very elevated concentrations of DMS due to spring and summer bloom, of Phaeocystis can not be reproduced. At 2 x CO2. the model estimates a small increase of global DMS flux to the atmosphere (+2\%,) but with large spatial heterogeneities (from -15\% to +30\% for the zonal mean). Mechanisms affecting DMS fluxes are changes in ( I) marine biological productivity. (2) relative abundance of phytoplankton species and (3) wind intensity. The mean DMS flux perturbation we simulate represents a small negative feedback on global warming however, the large regional changes may significantly impact regional temperature and precipitation pattern.},

abstract = {Large-scale univariate climate indices (such as NAO) are thought to outperform local weather variables in the explanation of trends in animal numbers but are not always suitable to describe regional scale patterns. We advocate the use of a Multivariate Oceanic and Climatic index (MOCI), derived from 'synthetic' and independent variables from a linear combination of the total initial variables objectively obtained from Principal Component Analysis. We test the efficacy of the index using long-term data from marine animal populations. The study area is the southern half of the Bay of Biscay (43 degrees-47 degrees N; western Europe). Between 1974 and 2000 we monitored cetaceans and seabirds along 131000 standardized line transects from ships. Fish abundance was derived from commercial fishery landings. We used 44 initial variables describing the oceanic and atmospheric conditions and characterizing the four annual seasons in the Bay of Biscay. The first principal component of our MOCI is called the South Biscay Climate (SBC) index. The winter NAO index was correlated to this SBC index. Inter-annual fluctuations for most seabird, cetacean and fish populations were significant. Boreal species (e.g. gadiformes fish species, European storm petrel and Razorbill ...) with affinities to cold temperate waters declined significantly over time while two (Puffin and Killer Whale) totally disappeared from the area during the study period. Meridional species with affinities to hotter waters increased in population size. Those medium-term demographic trends may reveal a regime shift for this part of the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the specific observed trends were highly correlated to the SBC index and not to the NAO. Between 40\% and 60\% of temporal variations in species abundance were explained by the multivariate SBC index suggesting that the whole marine ecosystem is strongly affected by a limited number of physical parameters revealed by the multivariate SBC index. Aside the statistical error of the field measurements, the remaining variation unexplained by the physical characteristics of the environment correspond to the impact of anthropogenic activities such overfishing and oil-spills.},

abstract = {During the past decades, phenology of many organisms has advanced in response to climate change [1]. Earlier arrival of long-distance migrants has been reported frequently [2, 3], but advancements of arrival and breeding were not always sufficient to match phenology at other trophic levels [4]. This has led to increased selection for early breeding [5] and severe population declines [6, 7]. This inadequate response has been explained by an inflexible start of migration, governed by cues unrelated to climate change, such as photoperiod [8]. It has been suggested that evolution at the genetic level is required for a change in photoresponsiveness [9]. Recently, such an evolutionary change in migration timing was suggested [10]. Here I show that timing of spring migration of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) has responded flexibly to climate change. Recovery dates during spring migration in Northern Africa advanced by ten days between 1980 and 2002, which was explained by improving Sahel rainfall and a phenotypic effect of birth date. The lack of advance on the breeding grounds most likely was due to environmental constraints during migration. Adjustment of arrival date in migrants to climate change could thus be rapid, but only if circumstances favorably change for the whole journey.},

abstract = {Across the California Current System (CCS), euphausiid crustaceans are important prey for many vertebrate predators, including the seabird Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus. However, the effects of ocean climate on euphausiid biology, and their consequences for predators, remain poorly understood. Over a 13 yr period (1996 to 2008), Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera and T inspinata cumulatively averaged about 35\% of the annual biomass in the nestling diets of auklets at Triangle Island, but there was marked inter-annual variation. Whereas ocean climate had little influence on the amounts of E. pacifica or T inspinata delivered, diets included more T spinifera if spring sea-surface temperatures in the previous year had been lower. Cold conditions might facilitate the production of a strong annual cohort, thus increasing adult biomass in the following year. Within seasons, the amount of E. pacifica in diets declined with date, and the decline was consistent across both warm- and cold-water years. In contrast, diets were especially rich in both Thysanoessa spp. late in the provisioning period in warm-water years, when the harvest of Neocalanus cristatus declined dramatically due to a temporal mismatch between the auklet predator and this copepod prey. Both the annual nestling survival rate and the mean fledging masses of Cassin's auklets were tightly correlated to the amount of N. cristatus in their diets, and for fledging mass there was a further small, additive effect of increased amounts of T inspinata. Results of the present study add new insight into effects of ocean climate on euphausiid biology in the northern CCS, and their potential consequences for population processes of an important euphausiid predator.},

abstract = {Over 100 food webs have been published for marine ecosystems to describe the transfer of food energy from its source in plants, through herbivores, to carnivores and higher order predators. The webs suggest that the lengths of the chains that form food webs are typically short (3-4 links), and that ecosystems with long food chains may be less stable than those with shorter food chains. Stomach contents have been the primary means for determining what marine organisms eat. More recently developed techniques include faecal analysis and fatty acid signatures from blood or fat samples. Consumption has been estimated from the volume of food found in stomachs, from the feeding rates of captive individuals and from bio-energetic modelling. Consumption of marine organisms, expressed as a percentage of an individual's body weight per day, ranges from about 4-15\% for zooplankton, to 1-4\% for cephalopods, 1-2\% for fish, 3-5\% for marine mammals and 15-20\% for sea birds. Immature age classes consume about twice as much (per unit of body weight) as do mature individuals. Furthermore, consumption is not constant throughout the year, but varies with seasonal periods of growth and reproduction. Most groups of species consume 3-10 times more than they produce, and export or pass up the food web about 70-95\% of their production. Marine organisms tend to be larger at successive trophic levels and are limited in the sizes of food they can consume. Humans are one of the few species that can prey upon almost any level of the food chain and any size of prey. Food web analysis and estimates of consumption are essential for understanding which ecosystems can support additional species, and which may be less stable and susceptible to species loss through the synergistic effects of fishing or culling. They are also critical tools for understanding changes in ecosystem dynamics as highlighted by a case study from the eastern Bering Sea.},

For some populations, however, climate change may render particular environments more favourable, with positive effects on population growth. We used a 30-year population dataset on over 2000 Common Eiders Somateria mollissima at a colony in southwest Iceland to examine the response of this species to climate fluctuations. Eiders are strongly dependent on suitable climatic conditions for successful reproduction and survival. Temperatures in southwest Iceland, in both winter and summer, have generally increased over the past 30 years but have shown considerable fluctuation. We show that females laid earlier following mild winters and that year-to-year variation in the number of nests was related to the temperature during the breeding season 2 years previously. Milder summers could have positive effects on breeding success and offspring survival, producing an increase in nest numbers 2 years later when most Eiders recruit into the breeding population. In this part of their range, Eiders could benefit from a general warming of the climate.},

abstract = {In variable environments, organisms are bound to track environmental changes if they are to survive. Most marine mammals and seabirds are colonial, central-place foragers with long-term breeding-site fidelity. When confronted with environmental change, such species are potentially constrained in their ability to respond to these changes. For example, if environmental conditions deteriorate within their limited foraging range, long-lived species favour adult survival and abandon their current breeding effort, which ultimately influences population dynamics. Should poor conditions persist over several seasons, breeding-site fidelity may force animals to continue breeding in low-quality habitats instead of emigrating towards more profitable grounds. We assessed the behavioural response of a site-faithful central-place forager, the Cape gannet Morus capensis, endemic to the Benguela upwelling system, to a rapid shift in the distribution and abundance of its preferred prey, small pelagic shoaling fish. We studied the distribution and the abundance of prey species, and the diet, foraging distribution, foraging effort, energy requirements, and breeding success of gannets at Malgas Island (South Africa) over four consecutive breeding seasons. Facing a rapid depletion of preferred food within their foraging range, Cape gannets initially increased their foraging effort in search of their natural prey. However, as pelagic fish became progressively scarcer, breeding birds resorted to scavenging readily available discards from a nearby demersal fishery. Their chicks cannot survive on such a diet, and during our 4-year study, numbers of breeding birds at the colony decreased by 40\% and breeding success of the remaining birds was very low. Such behavioural inflexibility caused numbers of Cape gannets breeding in Namibia to crash by 95\% following over-fishing of pelagic fish in the 1970s. In the context of rapid environmental changes, breeding-site fidelity of long-lived species may increase the risk of local or even global extinction, rendering these species particularly vulnerable to global change.},

abstract = {Squid are important components of many marine ecosystems from the poles to the equator, serving as both important predators and prey. Novel aspects of their growth and reproduction mean that they are likely to play an important role in the changing oceans due to climate change. Virtually every facet of squid life-history examined thus far has revealed an incredible capacity in this group for life-history plasticity. The extremely fast growth rates of individuals and rapid rates of turnover at the population level mean that squid can respond quickly to environmental or ecosystem change. Their 'life-in-the-fast-lane' lifestyle allows them to rapidly exploit 'vacuums' created in the ecosystem when predators or competitors are removed. In this way, they function as 'weeds of the sea'. Elevated temperatures accelerate the life-histories of squid, increasing their growth rates and shortening their life-spans. At first glance, it would be logical to suggest that rising water temperatures associated with climate change ( if food supply remains adequate) would be beneficial to inshore squid populations and fisheries-growth rates would increase, life spans would shorten and population turnover would accelerate. However, the response of inshore squid populations to climate change is likely to be extremely complex. The size of hatchlings emerging from the eggs becomes smaller as temperatures increase and hatchling size may have a critical influence on the size-at-age that may be achieved as adults and subsequently, population structure. The influence of higher temperatures on the egg and adult stages may thus be opposing forces on the life-history. The process of climate change will likely result in squids that hatch out smaller and earlier, undergo faster growth over shorter life-spans and mature younger and at a smaller size. Individual squid will require more food per unit body size, require more oxygen for faster metabolisms and have a reduced capacity to cope without food. It is therefore likely that biological, physiological and behavioural changes in squid due to climate change will have far reaching effects.},

abstract = {Recent climate change has affected the phenology of numerous species, and such differential changes may affect host-parasite interactions. Using information on vectors (louseflies, mosquitoes, blackflies) and parasites (tropical fowl mite Ornithonyssus bursa, the lousefly Ornithomyia avicularia, a chewing louse Brueelia sp., two species of feather mites Trouessartia crucifera and Trouessartia appendiculata, and two species of blood parasites Leucozytozoon whitworthi and Haemoproteus prognei) of the barn swallow Hirundo rustica collected during 1971-2008, I analyzed temporal changes in emergence and abundance, relationships with climatic conditions, and changes in the fitness impact of parasites on their hosts. Temperature and rainfall during the summer breeding season of the host increased during the study. The intensity of infestation by mites decreased, but increased for the lousefly during 1982-2008. The prevalence of two species of blood parasites increased during 1988-2008. The timing of first mass emergence of mosquitoes and blackflies advanced. These temporal changes in phenology and abundance of parasites and vectors could be linked to changes in temperature, but less so to changes in precipitation. Parasites had fitness consequences for hosts because intensity of the mite and the chewing louse was significantly associated with delayed breeding of the host, while a greater abundance of feather mites was associated with earlier breeding. Reproductive success of the host decreased with increasing abundance of the chewing louse. The temporal decrease in mite abundance was associated with advanced breeding of the host, while the increase in abundance of the lousefly was associated with earlier breeding. Virulence by the tropical fowl mite decreased with increasing temperature, independent of confounding factors. These findings suggest that climate change affects parasite species differently, hence altering the composition of the parasite community, and that climate change causes changes in the virulence of parasites. Because the changing phenology of different species of parasites had both positive and negative effects on their hosts, and because the abundance of some parasites increased, while that of other decreased, there was no consistent temporal change in host fitness during 1971-2008.},

abstract = {Climatic warming is affecting oceanic circulation patterns in coastal upwelling areas, but the impact of this climatic change on pelagic fish populations remains unclear. From juvenile landings collected over 38 years, the thresholds of environmental factors were determined that limited the optimal environmental window (OEW) for sardine (Sardina pilchardus recruitment success in the northwestern Iberian peninsula. The environmental factors considered were: water column stability in February, offshore water transport in March-April (Q(x)MA), upwelling intensity in the preceding year from May to August (Q(x)MJJA), and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. From 1875 to the mid-1920s, the mean number of years within the OEW was relatively constant. However, since the mid-1920s, there have been oscillations and alternating decades with high and low number of years within the OEW, which were related to oscillations in sardine landings. From 1906 to 2000, there were four record, tow sardine catches in the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, related to a high number of successive years with prevailing conditions out of the OEW. From 1875 to the present, a high year-to-year variation of the NAO, Q(x)MJJA and water stability in February was observed, although with mean values usually within the OEW. The collapse in the 1950s was related, partly, to successive years with low Q(x)MJJA. Successive years with high NAO values may be related to the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1990s. Q(x)MA has been the most significant factor controlling SRS in this area, being the factor related to the low catches observed in the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. Water stability was not responsible for any of the collapses observed, but since the 1920s, there has been a significant trend toward decreasing water column stability before the onset of the spring bloom.},

abstract = {1. Meteorological conditions are critical determinants of bird migration. However, response to weather should vary among species as well as between males and females, as phenotypic traits relevant to migration are also shaped by natural selection acting differentially on species and either sex in other life cycle phases. 2. We studied the covariation between capture frequencies and meteorological conditions at departure and at a stopover site during northward spring migration in 21 species of migratory birds. The stopover site is a small island located at the northern end of a wide ecological barrier (the Mediterranen Sea), that is crossed with non-stop flights by migrants departing from North Africa. 3. Head and crosswinds at departure, and tail and crosswinds at stopover reduced the number of birds captured, although the strength of these effects varied among species. In the subset of 10 sexually dimorphic species, males and females were not differentially susceptible to weather conditions. 4. Because sexual and natural selection pressures on traits relevant to migration vary among species, we investigated whether body mass and wing morphology predicted species susceptibility to weather in analyses controlling for phylogenetic effects, using wing loading, wing aspect ratio, the 'brachial index', and wingtip roundedness and convexity as indicators of the morphology of the flight apparatus. 5. Captures of species whose wing morphology is more typical of long-distance migrants were less affected by tail and crosswinds, suggesting that long-distance migrants are less susceptible to weather. 6. Meteorological conditions at departure independently concurred with those at stopover in determining capture frequencies. The effect of weather on migration covaried with wing morphological traits that co-evolved with migratory strategies. Changes in meteorological conditions driven by current climate change thus have the potential to differentially affect migration phenology in relation to migratory strategy and morphology of individual species.},

abstract = {1. The impact of climate on marine ecosystems is now well documented, but remains complex. Climate change may interact with human activities to effect population dynamics. In addition, in migratory species conditions are different between the breeding and wintering grounds, resulting in more complex dynamics. All these possible effects should be considered to predict the future of endangered species, but very few studies have investigated such combined interactions. 2. As a case study, we assessed the relative impact of fisheries and of oceanographic conditions in breeding and wintering sites on adult survival and breeding success of a population of the endangered black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys in the Kerguelen Islands, Southern Indian Ocean. This study was based on long-term monitoring of individually marked individuals (1979-2005) and identification by tracking studies and band recoveries of the oceanic feeding zones used during breeding and non-breeding seasons. 3. Breeding success was variable until 1997 and then declined gradually, from 0.88 to 0.48 chicks per egg laid. It was favoured by positive sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and trawl fishery during the breeding period, whereas it was negatively affected by positive SSTA around Tasmania, where the species winters. Adult survival was 0.918 +/- 0.004 on average and increased with SSTA during incubation, but decreased significantly with high tuna longlining effort in the wintering zone. 4. Our analyses show that demographic parameters were influenced by both climate and fisheries in both breeding and wintering grounds, but with different effect size. Black-browed albatross breeding success was more favoured by trawlers' offal and discards than by any of the seasonally/spatially oceanographic conditions, whereas their survival was equally affected by tuna longline fishery through incidental by-catch and spring SSTA. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our work underlines that a comprehensive knowledge of the life history of a species in all the habitats used is important to disentangle the respective roles of environmental conditions and human factors on population dynamics. Identification of these effects is required when proposing effective conservation measures, because the conservation of threatened species may depend on their wintering country's exclusive economic zones.},

abstract = {Phenological responses to climate change differ across trophic levels, which may lead to birds failing to breed at the time of maximal food abundance. Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca. In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90\% over the past two decades in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient. Mistiming as a result of climate change is probably a widespread phenomenon, and here we provide evidence that it can lead to population declines.},

Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO(2) levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine how climatic (North Atlantic Oscillation winter index, NAO, December through March), oceanographic (upwelling intensity, turbulence, water column stability and larval offshore transport) and biotic (adult abundance) factors affect recruitment success of Sardina pilchardus off the northwest coast of the Iberian peninsula. Annual sardine juvenile landings in the port of Vigo (Spain) from 1980 to 2000 were used as an indicator of sardine recruitment success. Ekman transport along the x-axis (Q(x)) in February (Q(x)F), from March to April (Q(x)MA), from May to August over the preceding year (Q(x)MJJA), and NAO explained 86\% of the variance observed in catches of sardine juveniles. Due to the north-south orientation of the west coast of the Iberian peninsula, upwelling intensity and larval drift offshore are higher the lower the Q(x). Landings of sardine juveniles were higher in those years with moderate Q(x)F, high Q(x)MA, low Q(x)MJJA and low NAO values. There was a dome-shaped relationship between sardine juvenile landings and Q(x)F. Under both high and low Q(x) conditions, the upper layer is strongly mixed. Therefore, the reduced recruitment success observed at both high and low Q(x)F values could be due to a stratified upper layer in February enhancing primary production during the spring bloom and, hence, larval food availability. As March and April are the Main spawning periods for sardine in this area, the reduced sardine recruitment success observed as Q(x)MA decreased was probably due to the transport offshore of eggs and larvae. In this area the main upwelling season is from May to August. Therefore, the positive relationship between upwelling intensity from May, to August and nutrient concentration in surface layers could explain why landings of sardine were higher when Q(x)MJJA over the preceding year was lower. Finally, in years with low NAO sardine recruitment success was higher. When NAO is lower than average, the winter/spring temperatures are warmer and transport offshore is lower.},

abstract = {Coastal marine systems, the interface between the ocean and terrestrial realms, are among the most important systems on the planet both ecologically and economically because of their crucial role in earth system functioning. Although direct impacts of human activities on physical, chemical and biological components of these systems have been widely documented, the potential influence of climate variability is less well known. Here, we used data from Service d'Observation en Milieu Littoral (SOMLIT), a marine monitoring programme that has since 1997 collected samples at 12 sites located along the French coasts from 42 degrees to 51 degrees N. Applying standardised principal component analysis (PCA), we documented the year-to-year fluctuations in these coastal systems and evaluated the potential influence of climate variability using data on atmospheric circulation (wind intensity and direction), precipitation and temperature. Our study revealed a pronounced sensitivity of these systems to climate variability. As the impact of climate change may become more prominent in the next decades, this study suggests that climate might strongly influence the marine coastal environment and act in synergism with other anthropogenic pressures to alter the state and functioning of biological and ecological systems and the services they provide.},

However, beyond the multiple modelling approaches, we lack empirical evidence of contemporary climate change impacts on populations in broad taxonomic groups and at continental scales. Identifying reliable predictors of species resilience or susceptibility to climate warming is of critical importance in assessing potential risks to species, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here we analysed long-term trends of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (20 countries), to identify climate niche characteristics, adjusted to other environmental and life history traits, that predict large-scale population changes accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species. Beyond the now well-documented decline of farmland specialists, we found that species with the lowest thermal maxima (as the mean spring and summer temperature of the hottest part of the breeding distribution in Europe) showed the sharpest declines between 1980 and 2005. Thermal maximum predicted the recent trends independently of other potential predictors. This study emphasizes the need to account for both land-use and climate changes to assess the fate of species. Moreover, we highlight that thermal maximum appears as a reliable and simple predictor of the long-term trends of such endothermic species facing climate change.},

abstract = {Recent climate change has sparked an interest in the timing of biological events, which is a general problem in life-history evolution. Reproduction in many organisms breeding in seasonal environments, e.g. migratory birds, is dependent on the exploitation of a short but rich food supply. If the seasonal timing of the food peak advances owing to climate change, then one would expect the bird to track those changes, hence, initiate migration and breeding earlier. However, when there is competition for territories and a risk of pre-breeding mortality, the optimal response to a shifting food distribution is no longer obvious. We develop a theoretical model to study how the optimal arrival time depends on the mean and variance of the food distribution, the degree of competition for territories and the risk of mortality. In general, the optimal shift in arrival date should never be as extreme as the shift in food peak date. Our results also show that we should expect the high variation of trends in arrival date observed among migratory birds, even if migration and information about climate change were unconstrained.},

abstract = {1. In response to warmer spring conditions in Central Europe many migratory bird species have shifted their timing of breeding. Environmental change has also led to warmer winters, shortening the distance between the breeding grounds of migratory birds and their overwintering areas. 2. Here, we show that in response to warmer winters, blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), but not great tits (Parus major), breeding in Germany decreased their migration distance between 1964 and 1996. Understanding this difference provides insight into possible constraints and selection pressures involved in how species respond to environmental change. Here, we focus on their breeding ecology. 3. In a nest box population in southern Germany, both species laid their first clutch earlier with increasing spring temperature, but over the study period (1974-1999) blue tits showed a significant and stronger advancement in laying date than great tits. For both species, selection for earlier breeding did not vary with environmental change, indicating that early laying pairs did not do better than later laying pairs as spring temperature increased. 4. Blue tits in the nest box population were single-brooded and existing hypotheses state that single-brooded species likely advance their laying date to match timing of reproduction with the advancing food peak in spring. We hypothesize that this might be one reason why blue tits adjusted their migration strategy as closer proximity to the breeding grounds in winter allows better prediction of the onset of spring. Ten per cent of great tits successfully produced second broods and their first clutch laying date is a compromise between first and second clutch laying date, which might be why great tits had not advanced their laying date nor altered their migration strategy.},

abstract = {Spring temperatures in temperate regions have increased over the past 20 years, and many organisms have responded to this increase by advancing the date of their growth and reproduction. Here we show that adaptation to climate change in a long-distance migrant is constrained by the timing of its migratory journey. For long-distance migrants climate change may advance the phenology of their breeding areas, but the timing of some species' spring migration relies on endogenous rhythms that are not affected by climate change. Thus, the spring migration of these species will not advance even though they need to arrive earlier on their breeding grounds to breed at the appropriate time. We show that the migratory pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca has advanced its laying date over the past 20 years. This temporal shift has been insufficient, however, as indicated by increased selection for earlier breeding over the same period. The shift is hampered by its spring arrival date, which has not advanced. Some of the numerous long-distance migrants will suffer from climate change, because either their migration strategy is unaffected by climate change, or the climate in breeding and wintering areas are changing at different speeds, preventing adequate adaptation.},

abstract = {Climate change is now known to be affecting the oceans. It is widely anticipated that impacts on marine mammals will be mediated primarily via changes in prey distribution and abundance and that the more mobile (or otherwise adaptable) species may be able to respond to this to some extent. However, the extent of this adaptability is largely unknown. Meanwhile, within the last few years direct observations have been made of several marine mammal populations that illustrate reactions to climate change. These observations indicate that certain species and populations may be especially vulnerable, including those with a limited habitat range, such as the vaquita Phocoena sinus, or those for which sea ice provides an important part of their habitat, such as narwhals Monodon monoceros, bowhead Balaena mysticetus and beluga Delphinapterus leucas whales and polar bears Ursus maritimus. Similarly, there are concerns about those species that migrate to feeding grounds in polar regions because of rapidly changing conditions there, and this includes many baleen whale populations. This review highlights the need to take projected impacts into account in future conservation and management plans, including species assessments. How this should be done in an adequately precautionary manner offers a significant challenge to those involved in such processes, although it is possible to identify at this time at least some species and populations that may be regarded as especially vulnerable. Marine ecosystems modellers and marine mammal experts will need to work together to make such assessments and conservation plans as robust as possible.},

abstract = {Contributing roughly half of the biosphere's net primary production (NPP), photosynthesis by oceanic phytoplankton is a vital link in the cycling of carbon between living and inorganic stocks. Each day, more than a hundred million tons of carbon in the form of CO2 are fixed into organic material by these ubiquitous, microscopic plants of the upper ocean, and each day a similar amount of organic carbon is transferred into marine ecosystems by sinking and grazing. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass and NPP is defined by the availability of light and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, iron). These growth-limiting factors are in turn regulated by physical processes of ocean circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, upwelling, atmospheric dust deposition, and the solar cycle. Satellite measurements of ocean colour provide a means of quantifying ocean productivity on a global scale and linking its variability to environmental factors. Here we describe global ocean NPP changes detected from space over the past decade. The period is dominated by an initial increase in NPP of 1,930 teragrams of carbon a year (Tg C yr(-1)), followed by a prolonged decrease averaging 190 Tg C yr(-1). These trends are driven by changes occurring in the expansive stratified low-latitude oceans and are tightly coupled to coincident climate variability. This link between the physical environment and ocean biology functions through changes in upper-ocean temperature and stratification, which influence the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. The observed reductions in ocean productivity during the recent post-1999 warming period provide insight on how future climate change can alter marine food webs.},

abstract = {Arctic climate change from the Paleocene epoch to the present is reconstructed with the objective of assessing its recent and future impacts on the ecology of the North Atlantic. A recurring theme in Earth's paleoclimate record is the importance of the Arctic atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere in regulating global climate on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. A second recurring theme in this record is the importance of freshwater export from the Arctic in regulating global- to basin-scale ocean circulation patterns and climate. Since the 1970s, historically unprecedented changes have been observed in the Arctic as climate warming has increased precipitation, river discharge, and glacial as well as sea-ice melting. In addition, modal shifts in the atmosphere have altered Arctic Ocean circulation patterns and the export of freshwater into the North Atlantic. The combination of these processes has resulted in variable patterns of freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean and the emergence of salinity anomalies that have periodically freshened waters in the North Atlantic. Since the early 1990s, changes in Arctic Ocean circulation patterns and freshwater export have been associated with two types of ecological responses in the North Atlantic. The first of these responses has been an ongoing series of biogeographic range expansions by boreal plankton, including renewal of the trans-Arctic exchanges of Pacific species with the Atlantic. The second response was a dramatic regime shift in the shelf ecosystems of the Northwest Atlantic that occurred during the early 1990s. This regime shift resulted from freshening and strati. cation of the shelf waters, which in turn could be linked to changes in the abundances and seasonal cycles of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and higher trophic-level consumer populations. It is predicted that the recently observed ecological responses to Arctic climate change in the North Atlantic will continue into the near future if current trends in sea ice, freshwater export, and surface ocean salinity continue. It is more difficult to predict ecological responses to abrupt climate change in the more distant future as tipping points in the Earth's climate system are exceeded.},

abstract = {Differential fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon during photosynthesis causes C-4 plants and C-3 plants to have distinct carbon-isotope signatures. In addition, marine C-3 plants have stable-isotope ratios of carbon that are intermediate between C-4 and terrestrial C-3 plants. The direct incorporation of the carbon-isotope ratio (C-13/C-12) of plants into consumers' tissues makes this ratio useful in studies of animal ecology. The heavy isotope of nitrogen (N-15) is preferentially incorporated into the tissues of the consumer from the diet, which results in a systematic enrichment in nitrogen-isotope ratio (N-15/N-14) with each trophic level. Consequently, stable isotopes of nitrogen have been used primarily to assess position in food chains. The literature pertaining to the use of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in animal trophic ecology was reviewed. Data from 102 studies that reported stable-isotope ratios of carbon and (or) nitrogen of wild birds and (or) mammals were compiled and analyzed relative to diet, latitude, body size, and habitat moisture. These analyses supported the predicted relationships among trophic groups. Carbon-isotope ratios differed among species that relied on C-3, C-4, and marine food chains. Likewise, nitrogen-isotope ratios were enriched in terrestrial carnivorous mammals relative to terrestrial herbivorous mammals. Also, marine carnivores that ate vertebrates had nitrogen-isotope ratios that were enriched over the ratios of those that ate invertebrates. Data from the literature also indicated that (i) the carbon-isotope ratio of carnivore bone collagen was inversely related to latitude, which was likely the result of an inverse relationship between the proportion of carbon in the food chain that was fixed by C-4 plants and latitude; (ii) seabirds and marine mammals from northern oceans had higher nitrogen-isotope ratios than those from southern oceans; (iii) the nitrogen-isotope ratios of terrestrial mammals that used xeric habitats were higher than the ratios of those that used mesic habitats, indicating that water stress can have important effects on the nitrogen-isotope ratio; (iv) there was no relationship between body mass and nitrogen-isotope ratio for either bone collagen or muscle of carnivores; and (v) there was linear covariation between stable-isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in marine food chains (but not in terrestrial C-3 or C-4 food chains), which is likely a product of increases in carbon-isotope ratio with trophic level in marine food chains. Differences in stable-isotope composition among trophic groups were detected despite variation attributable to geographic location, climate, and analytical techniques, indicating that these effects are large and pervasive. Consequently, as knowledge of the distribution of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen increases, they will probably become an increasingly important tool in the study of avian and mammalian trophic ecology.},

abstract = {Sandeels are known to be negatively affected by climate change in a number of ways. This study investigated whether these changes are affecting the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a species which consumes sandeels. Porpoise diet was examined in spring (March-May), a critical time of year for survival when sandeels are important prey, from 1993 to 2001 to provide baseline information on the proportion of sandeels consumed. When data from spring 2002 and 2003 were compared to these baseline data, the diet was found to be substantially different, with a significant and substantially smaller proportion of sandeels being consumed in March and May. There were also differences in the number of porpoises starving between the two time periods (33\% in spring 2002 and 2003 died of starvation, but only 5\% in the baseline period). This suggests that a lower proportion of sandeels in the diet of porpoises in spring increases the likelihood of starvation. Therefore, we suggest that the negative effects of climate change on sandeel availability may have serious negative effects on harbour porpoise populations in the North Sea by increasing the likelihood of starvation in spring.},

abstract = {Variability in ocean climate results in fluctuations in the timing and abundance of zooplankton. In turn, fluctuations in zooplankton as prey may have consequences for reproductive decisions and performance of planktivorous seabirds. We examined interrelationships between mean seasonal oceanographic conditions and prey availability and the timing of breeding, nestling diet, growth and productivity (as number of chicks fledged per breeding pair) of Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus in the central California Current System. Substantial inter-annual variability in seasonal ocean climate parameters as well as in auklet reproductive and diet characteristics was evident. Hatching dates and the proportion of all euphausiids in the diet were positively correlated with seasonal sea-surface temperature and negatively correlated with seasonal upwelling values, A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of Euphausia pacifica in the diet and hatch date, while significant positive correlations were found between Thysanoessa spinifera in the diet and productivity, and between productivity and growth. Based on the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations euphausiid data set, significant positive correlations were found between E. pacifica abundance and auklet meal mass and productivity and between T spinifera abundance and auklet productivity. As demonstrated by the auklet diet, euphausiids responded to changes in ocean climate on multiple temporal scales. In most years, auklets responded adaptively to variation in oceanographic conditions and prey availability by modifying timing of breeding. However, in years when ocean conditions deteriorated after the initiation of breeding, prey availability was severely reduced beyond the anklet's adaptive response, resulting in diminished nestling growth and productivity.},

abstract = {In long-lived vertebrates, individuals generally visit potential breeding areas or populations during one or more seasons before reproducing for the first time. During these years of prospecting, they select a future breeding site, colony, or mate and improve various skills and their physical condition to meet the requirements of reproduction. One precondition of successful reproduction is arrival in time on the breeding grounds. Here, we study the intricate links among the date of initial spring arrival, body mass, sex, and the age of first breeding in the common tern Sterna hirundo, a long-lived migratory colonial seabird. The study is based on a unique, individual-based, long-term dataset of sexed birds, marked with transponders, which allow recording their individual arrival, overall attendance, and clutch initiation remotely and automatically year by year over the entire lifetime at the natal colony site. We show that the seasonal date of initial arrival at the breeding grounds predicts the individual age at first reproduction, which mostly occurs years later. Late first-time arrivals remain delayed birds throughout subsequent years. Our findings reveal that timing of arrival at the site of reproduction and timing of reproduction itself are coherent parameters of individual quality, which are linked with the prospects of the breeding career and may have consequences for fitness.},

abstract = {The lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus is a key prey species for many marine birds in the North Sea. This fish is currently the target of the largest single species fishery in the area, and this has led to concern about the potential impact of the fishery on seabirds. There are 2 critical issues: does the breeding success of seabirds depend on sandeel availability and does the fishery reduce sandeel availability to a level at which avian reproductive output is affected? This paper investigates the first question in detail and briefly touches on the second by testing for correlations between productivity, breeding effort and diet in 3 species of seabird with contrasting foraging and dietary characteristics (common guillemot Uria aalge, black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, and European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and an index of availability of 1 group and older sandeels derived from catch per unit effort statistics from the Danish sandeel fishery. Breeding success in all 3 species was significantly reduced when sandeel availability to the fishery in June was low. There was also evidence that the timing of peak sandeel availability influenced reproductive output such that success was lower when availability peaked early. We speculate that these effects are linked to annual variations in sandeel life history events and, in particular, to the onset of burying behaviour of 1+ group fish and the arrival of 0 group sandeels on the seabirds' feeding grounds. Although the timing of these events is unlikely to be directly influenced by the sandeel fishery, since most catches are taken in June, it is possible that the fishery could exacerbate a difficult situation for seabirds by further reducing the biomass of available 1+ group fish. We suggest that this may have occurred in one of the years of the study.},

abstract = {Aim We tested whether a hybrid zone that has formed between an endemic and an invasive species of marine mussel has shifted poleward as expected under a general hypothesis of global warming or has responded instead to decadal climate oscillations. Location We sampled 15 locations on the coast of California, USA, that span the distributions of the two species of marine mussels and their hybrids. Methods Mussels were sampled in 2005-08 and analysed at three nuclear gene loci using methods identical to those used in a study a decade earlier in order to document the genetic architecture of this system. Change in the system was determined by comparing the frequency of species-specific alleles and multi-locus genotypes over the intervening decade. Climate variation over the same period was examined by comparing the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), upwelling indices and sea surface temperature (SST) during and prior to the study period. Results Contrary to the general expectations of global warming we show that the highly invasive warm-water mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the hybrid zone formed with the endemic species Mytilus trossulus has rapidly contracted southwards. Mytilus galloprovincialis declined in abundance over the northern third of its geographic range (c. 540 km) and has become rare or absent across the northern 200 km of the range it previously colonized during its initial invasion. The distribution of the native species M. trossulus has remained unchanged over the same time period. Main conclusions The large-scale range shift in the warm-water invasive species M. galloprovincialis and the hybrid zone it forms with M. trossulus has been exceptionally rapid and is in the opposite direction to that predicted by the global warming hypotheses. This shift, however, is consistent with decadal climate variation associated with the ENSO and the PDO. Since the biogeography of this system was first described in 1999, the PDO has shifted from a warm phase, dominated by frequent and large El Nino events, to a cold-phase period, with minimal ENSO activity. Thus recent decadal climate variation can oppose global trends in average temperature and this study illustrates the need to integrate the effects of climate change across multiple time-scales.},

abstract = {Climate change has been shown to affect the timing of reproduction, with earlier reproduction being associated with an increase in temperature. Changes in the timing of reproduction arise from changes in food availability as well as other factors, and differences in the timing of reproduction among sites may cause sites with early reproduction to contribute disproportionately to local recruitment. In this study, spatial variation in the laying date of barn swallows Hirundo rustica at 39 sites in a 45-km2 study area during the period 1971-2004 was used to investigate micro-geographic patterns in the timing of breeding. I found that individuals breeding at sites with early reproduction had a disproportionately large reproductive success. Early sites were characterized by early plant phenology, as determined by the date of leafing of the broad-leaved elm Ulmus glabra and date of flowering of the snowdrop Galanthus nivalis during a single year. Such early sites showed greater advancement in laying date between 1971 and 2004 than the average site. Early sites were also generally occupied during more years by a larger number of breeders than were late sites. Breeders at early sites produced more fledglings, and breeders at such sites were characterized by a smaller adult body size and larger secondary sexual characters than individuals at the average site. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that temporal changes in the timing of reproduction occur as a consequence of differential recruitment at phenologically early sites that produce disproportionately large numbers of offspring.},

Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production. Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.},

abstract = {As part of a project comparing the structure and function of four marine ecosystems off Norway and the United States, this paper examines the oceanographic responses to climate forcing, with emphasis on recent changes. The four Northern Hemisphere ecosystems include two in the Pacific Ocean (Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska) and two in the Atlantic Ocean (Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine and the Barents/Norwegian Seas). Air temperatures, wind forcing and heat fluxes over the four regions are compared as well as ocean hydrography and sea-ice conditions where seasonal sea ice is found. The long-term interannual variability in air temperatures, winds and net heat fluxes show strong similarity between adjacent ecosystems and within subregions of an ecosystem, but no significant correlations between Pacific and Atlantic ecosystems and few across the Atlantic. In spite of the lack of correlation between climate forcing and ocean conditions between most of the ecosystems, recent years have seen record or near record highs in air and sea temperatures in all ecosystems. The apparent causes of the warming differ. In the Atlantic, they appear to be due to advection, while in the Pacific temperatures are more closely linked to air-sea heat exchanges. Advection is also responsible for the observed changes in salinity in the Atlantic ecosystems (generally increasing salinity in the Barents and Norwegian Seas and decreasing in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank) while salinity changes in the Gulf of Alaska are largely related to increased local runoff.},

abstract = {We examined long-term (1943-2003) variability in laying dates and clutch sizes in a Finnish population of the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca Pallas, and analysed whether potential changes were explained by changes in climatic factors at the wintering area in Africa, at migration route or at breeding grounds. Among-year variation in both mean and skewness of laying dates increased, which for mean laying date appeared to be explained by variability of temperatures at the breeding grounds and for skewness by variable temperature trends along the migration route. Pied flycatchers bred earlier in warm springs, but despite a warming trend in pre-laying temperatures, the laying dates tended to delay. Laying dates became continuously later in relation to the phenology of the environment. Mean clutch size decreased with time when mean laying date was controlled for, but the climatic factors did not appear to explain the decrease. The advancement of spring phenology may have shifted some food sources needed for egg-laying, thus leading to later laying and smaller clutches. Variation in clutch size increased when wintering conditions were favourable so that clutch size distribution was skewed with a tail of small clutches when there had been lot of rainfall (more vegetation and insects) in the wintering area. We suggest that when ecological conditions during winter were good, the tail of small clutches represented low-quality individuals that were not able to breed after bad winters. Our analyses demonstrate that measures of spread and symmetry give different information about population level changes than means, and thus complement the understanding of the potential influences of climate change on populations.},

abstract = {Peer reviewed journals throughout the world have adopted similar review practices in an effort to select the best among submitted manuscripts and to improve their quality before publication. These practices have been justified mainly by tradition and argument. Considering the high stakes of publication, peer review practices should be supported by scientific evidence that they improve outcomes (such as better published manuscripts) and by sound ethical reasoning that they are justifiable. A small but growing number of scientific studies of peer review can help guide the choice of peer review practices, but their generalisability is limited by the great variety of journals, reviewers, and editors, and the evidence for the overall effectiveness of current peer review practices is not clear cut. Nevertheless, there is an empirical basis for such practices as selecting and instructing reviewers, masking them to the author’s identity, and asking them to sign reviews. Participation in peer review also has important beneficial effects on the medical community as a whole, whether or not the manuscript is published, by providing a vehicle for communication among scholars and by reinforcing ethical standards in the conduct of research. The cost of peer review is only a small proportion of the total budget of the journal. In the absence of conclusive evidence that usual peer review practices are best, variation in peer review practices is defensible, but should be accompanied by vigorous debate about their value and strong research into their effectiveness.},

abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at "quasi-baseline" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

In order to support the emergence of Grid-based scientific collaboration, new models of e-Science working methods are needed. Scientific collaboration involves production and manipulation of various artefacts. Based on work done in the software engineering field, this paper proposes models and tools which will support the representation and production of such artefacts. It is necessary to provide facilities to classify, organise, acquire, process, share, and reuse artefacts generated during collaborative working. The concept of a "design space" will be used to organise scientific design and the composition of experiments, and methods such as self-organising maps will be used to support the reuse of existing artefacts. It is proposed that this work can be carried out and evaluated in the UK e-Science community, using an "industry as laboratory" approach to the research, building on the knowledge, expertise, and experience of those directly involved in e-Science.},

To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. METHODOLOGY: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.},

@article{Duval2006a,
abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to CAMA06, the "1st International ACM Workshop on Contextualized Attention Metadata: Collecting, Managing and Exploiting of Rich Usage Information".The focus of the workshop is the capture and analysis of user behavior, so as to enable more effective and efficient support for the tasks and activities that the user is engaging in. This research has some direct implications in the real world: information systems that address users needs in a more direct and transparent way are more valuable. Indeed, this can be translated in some contexts in direct monetary metrics, e.g. by making money through targeted advertisements. In other contexts, there may be a less direct monetary gain, as in the case of fundamental research support or community strengthening initiatives.In order to increase the relevance of information and services further, usage data are increasingly used for "mass customization". Thus, the value and pertinence of data about the user and her interactions with systems and applications becomes increasingly obvious. As an example, tracking user interaction with and across websites is a major area for global services (including free ones like Google Analytics). Furthermore, several organizations have set out to collect data about user interactions across websites, e.g. AttentionTrust (http://www.attentiontrust.org/). Google's GMail illustrates how this kind of information can be used for targeted advertisements based on continuous analysis of incoming and outgoing email traffic.The main concern in all these efforts is capturing and analyzing the interactions of users, trying to figure out why they do what they do when they do it. The data captured, called attention metadata, typically include some information about the user, as well as about her interactions with an application (understood in a broad sense here). One issue is to be able to gather such data across different systems, which requires some form of user identification, with the associated concerns around security and privacy. The interactions depend on the type of tool, and can include following links (e.g. within a browser), activating user interface widgets (e.g. in a closed information system like SAP), following usage patterns (e.g. at specific websites), submitting search terms and selecting results (e.g. in a search engine session).There are two general approaches to capture attention metadata: Either the data is captured intrusively by asking the user to complete (online) questionnaires or through direct user observations that the user may or may not be aware of. Intrusive methods are generally less reliable. Data gathered by direct observation is more likely to be "true" as the user is less aware of the observation. More importantly, direct observation does not interfere with the primary goal of the user: after all, she is using an application to pursue her own interest, and any overhead involved in capturing what she is trying to do, why and how is just that: overhead, that should be avoided if at all possible. Sources for attention metadata are log files of servers and applications (e.g. browsers and email clients, chat tools, office tools, etc.), which can be obtained without disturbing the user. In order to draw on the benefits of both methods, several systems employ a hybrid method using elements from observation and enquiry.The analysis of attention metadata can focus either on the user (or group of users) or the application. Examples of the outcome of such analysis are statistics about the information, e.g. the number of times it has been read or downloaded, or about the user, e.g. the information she read, downloaded, exchanged with friends, etc. The most advanced analysis allows for some conclusions on the user goals, e.g. the Personal Reader (http://www.personal-reader.de/) that tries to provide additional information to a webpage read by a user. Such information can be fed back to the information system, in order to enable more targeted services.In general, the collection and analysis methods developed so far have some shortcomings. Attention metadata is mostly captured in one application only. The formats used to represent and store attention are highly diverse and heterogeneous, which makes the combination of such information over several applications very tedious and time-consuming. Furthermore, there are no standards to exchange attention information across system boundaries, e.g. between the desktop and the service provider.The combination of attention metadata from various sources provides a more complete view of user interactions. For example, such combination makes it possible to capture the whole information flow on the user desktop, from obtaining information, processing activities like storing, reading, distributing, deleting, and the repurposing of the information in newly authored documents. We call the combination of attention metadata from heterogeneous sources contextualized attention metadata of users. Contextualization of attention metadata refers to capturing data about the context in which a certain activity is carried out. For example, while writing a scientific paper, the author carries out certain tasks, e.g. writing the document, searching information on the web and on his desktop, sharing his thoughts about the paper with his co-authors via chat and email, drawing related graphs, etc. The task of capturing all these activities requires a scheme to include all the various types of user and activity metadata as well as its relation, hence contextualized attention metadata.The recently introduced AttentionXML (http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml) specification sets out to capture user interactions in terms of interoperable attention metadata. The core of AttentionXML is a schema that describes metadata on how people use information, e.g. what people read, comment on or listen to. Typical applications of AttentionXML focus on the attention that users spend on web pages, news feeds and blogs.Important as the AttentionXML specification is in bootstrapping "attention ecology", we believe that it is somewhat limited in the scope of attention metadata that it includes. For example, the schema does not allow capturing information about downloading, viewing or editing documents, applications and contexts where objects were used. That is why we have proposed an extension to AttentionXML that allows us to significantly broaden the usage scenarios of attention metadata. We call this new schema the contextualized attention metadata schema -- CAMs (http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/empirical/attention.php).Now that the schema is in place, various tools emerge to capture attention metadata, and the focus is shifting to the analysis of collected attention metadata. Apart from the technical problems of dealing with large amounts of data, the open questions deal with problems like user identification, classification of users and activities, deep mining for behavioral patterns, etc. Another issue that needs to be urgently addressed in a better way is security and privacy. Attention metadata includes highly personal information so that secure solutions have to be provided to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data, e.g. enabling the user to have full control over his attention metadata at all times. Last but not least, the integration of the new possibilities arising out of the usage of attention metadata have to be integrated into existing system to enhance their capabilities, e.g. in terms of highly targeted and personalized information provision.The CAMA 2006 workshop addresses the above outlined issues in a variety of presentations. As an opening, Steve Gillmor will elaborate on the future of attention metadata in commercial settings. The overview on the usage of attention metadata in real-world systems will include a brief discussion of the socio-technological perspective of attention metadata, thus outlining some of the more social problems like data-ownership. Furthermore, we will discuss the experiences with capturing and analyzing attention metadata, e.g. in a library environment, for the support of the corporate decision making process and in learning scenarios. Last but not least, we discuss several issues in real-world settings focusing on the capturing process, like how an attention recorder allows capturing highly detailed attention metadata or how the user file system can be mined for attention metadata.},

@article{Weale2004,
abstract = {Background: Current methods of measuring the quality of journals assume that citations of articles within journals are normally distributed. Furthermore using journal impact factors to measure the quality of individual articles is flawed if citations are not uniformly spread between articles. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of citations to articles and use the level of non-citation of articles within a journal as a measure of quality. This ranking method is compared with the impact factor, as calculated by ISI. Methods: Total citations gained by October 2003, for every original article and review published in current immunology (13125 articles; 105 journals) and surgical (17083 articles; 120 journals) fields during 2001 were collected using ISI Web of Science. Results: The distribution of citation of articles within an individual journal is mainly non-parametric throughout the literature. One sixth (16.7\%; IQR 13.619.2) of articles in a journal accrue half the total number of citations to that journal. There was a broader distribution of citation to articles in higher impact journals and in the field of immunology compared to surgery. 23.7\% (IQR 14.642.4) of articles had not yet been cited. Levels of non-citation varied between journals and subject fields. There was a significant negative correlation between the proportion of articles never cited and a journal's impact factor for both immunology (rho = -0.854) and surgery journals (rho = -0.924). Conclusion: Ranking journals by impact factor and non-citation produces similar results. Using a non-citation rate is advantageous as it creates a clear distinction between how citation analysis is used to determine the quality of a journal (low level of non-citation) and an individual article (citation counting). Non-citation levels should therefore be made available for all journals.},

@article{Mathys2011,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The 1980s marked the occasion when Geographical Information System (GIS) technology was broadly introduced into the geo-spatial community through the establishment of a strong GIS industry. This technology quickly disseminated across many countries, and has now become established as an important research, planning and commercial tool for a wider community that includes organisations in the public and private health sectors. The broad acceptance of GIS technology and the nature of its functionality have meant that numerous datasets have been created over the past three decades. Most of these datasets have been created independently, and without any structured documentation systems in place. However, search and retrieval systems can only work if there is a mechanism for datasets existence to be discovered and this is where proper metadata creation and management can greatly help. This situation must be addressed through support mechanisms such as Web-based portal technologies, metadata editor tools, automation, metadata standards and guidelines and collaborative efforts with relevant individuals and organisations. Engagement with data developers or administrators should also include a strategy of identifying the benefits associated with metadata creation and publication. FINDINGS: The establishment of numerous Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), and other Internet resources, is a testament to the recognition of the importance of supporting good data management and sharing practices across the geographic information community. These resources extend to health informatics in support of research, public services and teaching and learning. This paper identifies many of these resources available to the UK academic health informatics community. It also reveals the reluctance of many spatial data creators across the wider UK academic community to use these resources to create and publish metadata, or deposit their data in repositories for sharing. The Go-Geo! service is introduced as an SDI developed to provide UK academia with the necessary resources to address the concerns surrounding metadata creation and data sharing. The Go-Geo! portal, Geodoc metadata editor tool, ShareGeo spatial data repository, and a range of other support resources, are described in detail. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a variety of resources available for the health research and public health sector to use for managing and sharing their data. The Go-Geo! service is one resource which offers an SDI for the eclectic range of disciplines using GIS in UK academia, including health informatics. The benefits of data management and sharing are immense, and in these times of cost restraints, these resources can be seen as solutions to find cost savings which can be reinvested in more research.},

We combine qualitative methods (participant interviews) with quantitative methods (network analysis) and demonstrate the application and value of our approach in a case study comparing three research fields in chemistry. A mesoscopic level of analysis means that in addition to the basic analytic unit of the individual researcher as node in a co-author network, we base our analysis on the observed modular structure of co-author networks. We interpret the clustering of authors into groups as bibliometric footprints of the basic collective units of knowledge production in a research specialty. We find two types of coauthor-linking patterns between author clusters that we interpret as representing two different forms of cooperative behavior, transfer-type connections due to career migrations or one-off services rendered, and stronger, dedicated inter-group collaboration. Hence the generic coauthor network of a research specialty can be understood as the overlay of two distinct types of cooperative networks between groups of authors publishing in a research specialty. We show how our analytic approach exposes field specific differences in the social organization of research.},

This suggests that males and females of M. annua differentially modify the soil in which they are growing.

abstract = {Translation initiation on eukaryotic mRNAs involves 40S ribosome association with mRNA caps (m(7)GpppN), mediated by initiation factor eIF4F. 40S eukaryotic ribosomes and initiation factors undergo 5' scanning to the initiation codon, with no known role for complementarity between eukaryotic 18S rRNA and the 5' noncoding region of mRNAs. We demonstrate that the 5' noncoding region of human adenovirus late mRNAs, known as the tripartite leader, utilizes a striking complementarity to 18S rRNA to facilitate a novel form of translation initiation referred to as ribosome shunting, in which 40S ribosomes bind the cap and bypass large segments of the mRNA to reach the initiation codon. Related elements are also shown to promote ribosome shunting in adenovirus IVa2 intermediate phase mRNA during virus infection and in human heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA for selective translation during heat shock. The importance of mRNA complementarity to 18S rRNA suggests that ribosome shunting may involve either specific RNA structural features or a prokaryotic-like interaction between mRNA and rRNA.},

Although it has been known for a long time that these processes are functionally linked, often by the use of common protein factors, it has only recently become apparent that many of these processes are also physically connected. Indeed, proteins that are involved in mRNA degradation, translational repression, mRNA surveillance and RNA-mediated gene silencing, together with their mRNA targets, colocalize within discrete cytoplasmic domains known as P bodies. The available evidence indicates that P bodies are sites where mRNAs that are not being translated accumulate, the information carried by associated proteins and regulatory RNAs is integrated, and their fate - either translation, silencing or decay - is decided.},

Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by `natural selection'. Development, diversification, decay, extinction, and absence ofplan are all inherent to his theories. Darwin read prodigiously across many fields; he reflected on his experiences as a traveller; he experimented. His profoundly influential concept of `natural selection' condenses materials from past and present, from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens tocolonial encounters. The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin's emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever.

When expressed by transfection in human, monkey, hamster, rat, and mouse cell lines, the E1B protein was predominantly cytoplasmic and typically was excluded from the nucleus. When expressed by transfection, the E4 protein accumulated in the nucleus. Strikingly, when coexpressed by transfection in human, monkey, or baby hamster kidney cells, the E1B protein colocalized in the nucleus with the E4 protein. A complex of the E4 and E1B proteins was identified by coimmunoprecipitation in transfected HeLa cells. By contrast to the interaction observed in primate and baby hamster kidney cells, the E4 protein failed to direct the E1B protein to the nucleus in rat and mouse cell lines as well as CHO and V79 hamster cell lines. This failure of the E4 protein to direct the nuclear localization of the E1B protein in REF-52 rat cells was overcome by fusion with HeLa cells. Within 4 h of heterokaryon formation and with protein synthesis inhibited, a portion of the E4 protein present in the REF-52 nuclei migrated to the HeLa nuclei. Simultaneously, the previously cytoplasmic E1B protein colocalized with the E4 protein in both human and rat cell nuclei. These results suggest that a primate cell-specific factor mediates the functional interaction of the E1B and E4 proteins of adenovirus.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a novel strategy that simplifies the generation and production of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) mutants carrying defined mutations in early transcription units 1 (E1) and 4 (E4). The strategy involves three recombinant plasmids containing E1 (pE1-1235), E4 (pE4-1155), or the wild-type genome that lacks a portion of E3 (pH5pg4100). To generate recombinant viruses, mutations are first introduced into pE1- and/or pE4-transfer plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenized constructs are then ligated into plasmid pH5pg4100 containing the Ad backbone by direct cloning. Infectious viral DNAs are released from the recombinant plasmids by PacI-digestion and transfected into the complementing cell lines 293 or W162, and viral progeny are isolated and amplified. The advantages of this strategy are multiple: all cloning steps are carried out in Escherichia coli, and any genetic region of the viral E1 and/or E4 transcription units can be specifically modified or deleted. Moreover, foreign genes can be introduced into the E1 and/or E4 regions, and expression of viral or therapeutic genes can be controlled by cell-type specific and/or inducible promoters.},

abstract = {Robustness is a ubiquitously observed property of biological systems. It is considered to be a fundamental feature of complex evolvable systems. It is attained by several underlying principles that are universal to both biological organisms and sophisticated engineering systems. Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

abstract = {The mammalian F-box protein Fbw7 and its Caenorhabditis elegans counterpart Sel-10 have been implicated in the ubiquitin-mediated turnover of cyclin E as well as the Notch/Lin-12 family of transcriptional activators. Both unregulated Notch and cyclin E promote tumorigenesis, and inactivating mutations in human Fbw7 suggest that it may be a tumor suppressor. To generate an in vivo system to assess the consequences of such unregulated signaling, we generated mice deficient for Fbw7. Fbw7-null mice die around 10.5 days post coitus because of a combination of deficiencies in hematopoietic and vascular development and heart chamber maturation. The absence of Fbw7 results in elevated levels of cyclin E, concurrent with inappropriate DNA replication in placental giant trophoblast cells. Moreover, the levels of both Notch 1 and Notch 4 intracellular domains were elevated, leading to stimulation of downstream transcriptional pathways involving Hes1, Herp1, and Herp2. These data suggest essential functions for Fbw7 in controlling cyclin E and Notch signaling pathways in the mouse.},

abstract = {The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is required for mediating the S-phase checkpoint following UV treatment, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Here we demonstrate that at least two mechanisms are involved in regulating the S-phase checkpoint in an MRN-dependent manner following UV treatment. First, when replication forks are stalled, MRN is required upstream of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR) to facilitate ATR activation in a substrate and dosage-dependent manner. In particular, MRN is required for ATR-directed phosphorylation of RPA2, a critical event in mediating the S-phase checkpoint following UV treatment. Second, MRN is a downstream substrate of ATR. Nbs1 is phosphorylated by ATR at Ser-343 when replication forks are stalled, and this phosphorylation event is also important for down-regulating DNA replication following UV treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that MRN and ATR/ATR-interacting protein (TRIP) interact with each other, and the forkhead-associated/breast cancer C-terminal domains (FHA/BRCT) of Nbs1 play a significant role in mediating this interaction. Mutations in the FHA/BRCT domains do not prevent ATR activation but specifically impair ATR-mediated Nbs1 phosphorylation at Ser-343, which results in a defect in the S-phase checkpoint. These data suggest that MRN plays critical roles both upstream and downstream of ATR to regulate the S-phase checkpoint when replication forks are stalled.},

We demonstrate that E1B-AP5 methylation is enhanced during the course of infection in a cell-type-specific manner. We also show that L4-100 kDa is efficiently methylated in Ad-infected cells. L4-100 kDa formed complex with methyltransferase in vivo during productive infection, and can be methylated by HRMT1L2 (human protein arginine methyltransferase 1) in vitro. Comparative analysis of E1B-AP5 and L4-100 kDa protein methylation in Ad-infected HeLa, MCF-7 and H1299 cells revealed that the profile of protein arginine methylation correlates with the efficiency of Ad proteins production. Our results suggest that protein arginine methylation is an important host-cell function required for efficient Ad replication.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the spatial organization of large scale chromatin domains in chinese hamster fibroblast, human lymphoid (IM-9), and marsupial kidney epithelial (PtK) cells by labeling DNA at defined stages of S phase via pulsed incorporation of halogenated deoxynucleosides. Most, if not all, chromosomes contribute multiple chromatin domains to both peripheral and internal nucleoplasmic compartments. The peripheral compartment contains predominantly late replicating G/Q bands, whereas early replicating R bands preferentially localize to the internal nucleoplasmic compartment. During mitosis, the labeled chromatin domains that were separated in interphase form a pattern of intercalated bands along the length of each metaphase chromosome. The transition from a banded (mitotic) to a compartmentalized (interphasic) organization of chromatin domains occurs during the late telophase/early G1 stage and is independent of transcriptional activation of the genome. Interestingly, generation of micronuclei with a few chromosomes showed that the spatial separation of early and late replicating chromatin compartments is recapitulated independently of chromosome number, even in micronuclei containing only a single chromosome. Our data strongly support the notion that the compartmentalization of large-scale (band size) chromatin domains seen in the intact nucleus is a magnified image of a similar compartmentalization occurring in individual chromosome territories.},

Here, by comparing the linker histone-dependent compaction of long, reconstituted nucleosome arrays with different nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs), 167 and 197 bp, we establish that the compaction behavior is both NRL- and linker histone-dependent. Only the 197-bp NRL array can form 30-nm higher-order chromatin structure. Importantly for understanding the regulation of compaction, this array shows a cooperative linker histone-dependent compaction. The 167-bp NRL array displays a limited linker histone-dependent compaction, resulting in a thinner and topologically different fiber. These observations provide an explanation for the distribution of NRLs found in nature.},

Using a peptide phosphorylation assay we show here that EBER-1, like VAI, directly inhibits the activation of purified PKR. A second Epstein-Barr virus RNA, EBER-2, also regulates PKR. EBER-1, EBER-2 and VAI RNA exhibit mutually competitive binding to the native or recombinant enzyme, as assessed by U.V. crosslinking experiments and filter binding assays. The affinities of all three RNAs for PKR in vitro are similar (Kd = ca. 0.3 nM). Since this protein kinase has been proposed to exert a tumour suppressor function in vivo, the ability of EBER-1 to inhibit its activation suggests a role for this small RNA in cell transformation by Epstein-Barr virus.},

abstract = {During lytic infection, the genome of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is associated with limited levels of histones but does not form a regular repeating nucleosomal structure. However, the previous observation that chromatin remodeling factors are recruited into viral replication compartments indicates that chromatin remodeling plays a role in HSV-1 gene expression and DNA replication. In this study we demonstrate the presence of histone H3 on HSV-1 DNA early in infection at levels equivalent to those found on a cellular gene. The proportion of viral DNA associated with histone H3 decreases at later times postinfection, independently of either viral DNA replication or transcription. We demonstrate that an immediate-early protein, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), is required for both a reduction in the proportion of HSV-1 DNA associating with histone H3 and an increase in histone acetylation. This study provides evidence that ICP0 directly alters the chromatin structure of the HSV-1 genome during lytic infection, and this system will serve as a useful model for the reduction of histone load in higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which herpes simplex virus (HSV) exits the nucleus remains a matter of controversy. The generally accepted route proposes that capsids exit via primary envelopment at the inner nuclear membrane and subsequent fusion of this primary particle with the outer nuclear membrane to gain capsid entry to the cytoplasm. However, recent observations indicate that HSV may induce gross morphological alterations of nuclear pores, resulting in the loss of normal pores and the appearance of dilated gaps in the nuclear membrane of up to several 100 nm. On this basis, it was proposed that a main route of capsid exit from the nucleus is directly through these altered pores. Here, we examine the biochemical composition of some of the major nuclear pore components in uninfected and HSV-infected cells. We show that total levels of major nucleoporins and their sedimentation patterns in density gradients remain largely unchanged up to 18 h after HSV infection. Some alteration in modification of one nucleoporin, Nup358/RanBP2, was observed during enrichment with anti-nucleoporin antibody and probing for O glycosylation. In addition, we examine functional gating within the nucleus in live cells, using microinjection of labeled dextran beads and a recombinant virus expressing GFP-VP16 to track the progress of infection. The nuclear permeability barrier for molecules bigger than 70 kDa remained intact throughout infection.

abstract = {In many ways, plants offer unique systems through which to study sex determination. Because the production of unisexual flowers has evolved independently in many plant species, different and novel mechanisms may be operational. Hence, there is probably not one unifying mechanism that explains sex determination in plants. Advances in our understanding of sex determination will come from the analysis of the genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry of genes controlling sexual determination in plants. Several excellent model systems for bisexual floral development (Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum), monoecy (maize), and dioecy (Silene, asparagus, and mercury) are available for such analyses. The important questions that remain concern the mechanism of action of sex determination genes and their interrelationship, if any, with homeotic genes that determine the sexual identity of floral organ primordia. At the physiological level, the connection between hormone signaling and sexuality is not well understood, although significant correlations have been discovered. Finally, once the genes that regulate these processes are identified, cloned, and studied, new strategies for the manipulation of sexuality in plants should be forthcoming.},

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre—layout (or conventional) and layout—specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

abstract = {The p53-inhibitory function of the oncoprotein MDM2 is regulated by a number of MDM2-binding proteins, including ARF and ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23, which bind the central acidic domain of MDM2 and inhibit its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Various human cancer-associated MDM2 alterations targeting the central acidic domain have been reported, yet the functional significance of these mutations in tumor development has remained unclear. Here, we show that cancer-associated missense mutations targeting MDM2's central zinc finger disrupt the interaction of MDM2 with L5 and L11. We found that the zinc finger mutant MDM2 is impaired in undergoing nuclear export and proteasomal degradation as well as in promoting p53 degradation, yet retains the function of suppressing p53 transcriptional activity. Unlike the wild-type MDM2, whose p53-suppressive activity can be inhibited by L11, the MDM2 zinc finger mutant escapes L11 inhibition. Hence, the MDM2 central zinc finger plays a critical role in mediating MDM2's interaction with ribosomal proteins and its ability to degrade p53, and these roles are disrupted by human cancer-associated MDM2 mutations.},

abstract = {Connections between PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) and DNA virus replication have been investigated from the earliest days of the molecular characterization of PML and associated proteins. It appears to be a general feature of nuclear-replicating DNA viruses that their parental genomes preferentially become associated with PML NBs, and that their initial sites of transcription and development of DNA replication centres are frequently juxtaposed to these domains or their remnants. In addition, regulatory proteins encoded by several DNA viruses associate with and sometimes cause catastrophic changes to PML NBs by a variety of mechanisms. These events can be correlated with the efficiency of viral infection and the functions of viral regulatory proteins, but the underlying molecular connections between PML NB function and viral infection remain poorly understood. This article reviews the latest developments in the interactions between PML NBs and herpesviruses, adenoviruses and papovaviruses.},

The corresponding region in the closely related adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) encodes the spliced mRNA for viral protein IVa2 (Chow et al., 1979; Persson et al., 1979). Reverse transcription of the Ad5 pIVa2 mRNA localized the 5' terminus of the mRNA to approximately position 5840, and its splice coordinates to positions 5706 and 5427. From the data of Alestr\"{o}m et al. (1980) for Ad2, the 3' end of this mRNA was inferred to be specified by Ad5 nucleotide 4060. The nucleic acid data allow us to predict an Mr of 50873 for the IVa2 protein of Ad5, which is close to the experimentally determined value of 50000 (Persson et al., 1979).

abstract = {Coiled bodies are conserved subnuclear organelles that contain splicing snRNPs, a subset of nucleolar antigens, and the autoantigen p80 coilin. Most nuclei contain one to five nucleoplasmic coiled bodies, often with one or more located at the nucleolar periphery. Here we show that exposure of mammalian cells to low levels of the specific Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, results in the accumulation of p80 coilin and splicing snRNPs within nucleoli. Mutation of a single serine residue in p80 coilin to aspartate (S202D) also causes coiled bodies and splicing snRNPs to localize within nucleoli when the mutant is transiently transfected and expressed in HeLa cells. Neither okadaic acid nor the S202D coilin mutant causes nucleolar accumulation of serine-arginine-domain proteins. These data indicate that protein dephosphorylation is required to allow normal formation of nucleoplasmic coiled bodies and point to p80 coilin as a substrate whose phosphorylation state may regulate snRNP-nucleolar interactions. The data are consistent with a trafficking mechanism whereby splicing snRNPs cycle through the nucleolus.},

@article{Birch1948,
annote = {This was the first application of the statistic known as the intrinsic rate of natural increase to an insect population (the weevil Calandra oryzae). It was calculated from experimental data on the age schedule of births and deaths in controlled environments. The study was conducted under the objective of determining the most favorable environments for the storage of grain stockpiled in Australia during the World War II, and hence finding the environments less favorable for the multiplication of the insect pests of stored grain.

        
The measure was based on the demographic parameter developed by Lotka (Elements of physical biology, 1925) for human populations, and developed a few years after the first determination of the intrinsic rate of increase of an animal other than man made by Leslie \& Ranson (The mortality, fertility and rate of natural increase of the vole (Microtus agrestis) as observed in the laboratory, 1940) for the vole Microtus agrestis from age-specific rates of fecundity and mortality determined under laboratory conditions.

        
Birch defined the "intrinsic rate of natural increase" as "the rate of increase per head under specified physical conditions, in an unlimited environment where the effects of increasing density do not need to be considered". The growth of such a population is by definition exponential. This parameter is the "r" in the differential equation for population increase: dN/dt=rN, that is, the difference between the birth-rate and the death-rate in the population. It does not describe the actual rate of increase of a population at a particular point of time but the maximum rate that it can ever maintain over an indefinite period of time "in a population with a stable age distribution". 

        
The method used in the calculations provided a means of determining the extent to which various components enter into the value of the intrinsic rate of natural increase: 1) the life table: the probability at birth of being alive at age x; 2) the fecundity table: the mean number of female offspring produced in a unit of time by a female aged x; and 3) the length of the pre-reproductive stages. One of the results was that the intrinsic rate of natural increase of C. oryzae was determined to a much greater extent by the rate of egg-laying in the first two weeks of life than by the total number of eggs laid in the entire life of 30 weeks.},

abstract = {A number of proteins can be conjugated with both ubiquitin and the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), with crosstalk between these two post-translational modifications serving to regulate protein function and stability. We previously identified N4BP1 as a substrate for monoubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. Here, we describe Nedd4-mediated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of N4BP1. In addition, we show that N4BP1 can be conjugated with SUMO1 and that this abrogates N4BP1 ubiquitylation. Consistent with this, endogenous N4BP1 is stabilized in primary embryonic fibroblasts from mutants of the desumoylating enzyme SENP1, which show increased steady-state sumoylation levels. We have localized endogenous N4BP1 predominantly to the nucleolus in primary cells. However, a small fraction is found at promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs). In cells deficient for SENP1 or in wild-type cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, there is considerable accumulation of N4BP1 at PML NBs. These findings suggest a dynamic interaction between subnuclear compartments, and a role for post-translational modification by ubiquitin and SUMO in the regulation of nucleolar protein turnover.},

Here we show that during infection with wild-type adenovirus, ATR and its cofactors RPA32, ATRIP and TopBP1 accumulate at viral replication centres, but there is minimal ATR activation. We show that the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex is recruited to viral centres only during infection with adenoviruses lacking the early region E4 and ATR signaling is activated. This suggests a novel requirement for the MRN complex in ATR activation during virus infection, which is independent of Mre11 nuclease activity and recruitment of RPA/ATR/ATRIP/TopBP1. Unlike other damage scenarios, we found that ATM and ATR signaling are not dependent on each other during infection. We identify a region of the viral E4orf3 protein responsible for immobilization of the MRN complex and show that this prevents ATR signaling during adenovirus infection. We propose that immobilization of the MRN damage sensor by E4orf3 protein prevents recognition of viral genomes and blocks detrimental aspects of checkpoint signaling during virus infection.},

abstract = {We have visualized the intranuclear topography of adenovirus replication and transcription in infected HeLa cells. The results show that viral DNA replication occurs in multiple foci that are highly organized in the nucleoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that newly synthesized viral double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread throughout the nucleoplasm, while the single-stranded DNA replication intermediates accumulate in adjacent sites. Double-labelling experiments and confocal microscopy show that replication occurs in foci localized at the periphery of the sites where single-stranded DNA accumulates. The simultaneous visualization of viral replication and transcription reveals that the sites of transcription are predominantly separated from the sites of replication. Transcription is detected adjacent to the replication foci and extends around the sites of single-stranded DNA accumulation. These data indicate that newly synthesized double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread in the surrounding nucleoplasm, where they are used as templates for transcription. Splicing snRNPs are shown to co-localize with the sites of transcription and to be excluded from the sites of replication. This provides evidence that splicing of viral RNAs occurs co-transcriptionally and that the sites of viral DNA replication are spatially distinct from the sites of RNA transcription and processing.},

abstract = {Human adenoviruses (Ads) replicate and assemble particles in the nucleus. They organize a linear double-strand DNA genome into a condensed core with about 180 nucleosomes, by the viral proteins VII (pVII), pX, and pV attaching the DNA to the capsid. Using reverse genetics, we generated a novel, nonconditionally replicating Ad reporter by inserting green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the amino terminus of pV. Purified Ad2-GFP-pV virions had an oversized complete genome and incorporated about 38 GFP-pV molecules per virion, which is about 25\% of the pV levels in Ad2. GFP-pV cofractionated with the DNA core, like pV, and newly synthesized GFP-pV had a subcellular localization indistinguishable from that of pV, indicating that GFP-pV is a valid reporter for pV. Ad2-GFP-pV completed the replication cycle, although at lower yields than Ad2. Incoming GFP-pV (or pV) was not imported into the nucleus. Virions lost GFP-pV at two points during the infection process: at entry into the cytosol and at the nuclear pore complex, where capsids disassemble. Disassembled capsids, positive for the conformation-specific antihexon antibody R70, were devoid of GFP-pV. The loss of GFP-pV was reduced by the macrolide antibiotic leptomycin B (LMB), which blocks nuclear export and adenovirus attachment to the nuclear pore complex. LMB inhibited the appearance of R70 epitopes on Ad2 and Ad2-GFP-pV, indicating that the loss of GFP-pV from Ad2-GFP-pV is an authentic step in the adenovirus uncoating program. Ad2-GFP-pV is genetically complete and hence enables detailed analyses of infection and spreading dynamics in cells and model organisms or assessment of oncolytic adenoviral potential.},

abstract = {Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been accomplished by expressing pluripotency factors and oncogenes, but the low frequency and tendency to induce malignant transformation compromise the clinical utility of this powerful approach. We address both issues by investigating the mechanisms limiting reprogramming efficiency in somatic cells. Here we show that reprogramming factors can activate the p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice, TP53 in humans) pathway. Reducing signalling to p53 by expressing a mutated version of one of its negative regulators, by deleting or knocking down p53 or its target gene, p21 (also known as Cdkn1a), or by antagonizing reprogramming-induced apoptosis in mouse fibroblasts increases reprogramming efficiency. Notably, decreasing p53 protein levels enabled fibroblasts to give rise to iPS cells capable of generating germline-transmitting chimaeric mice using only Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2. Furthermore, silencing of p53 significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency of human somatic cells. These results provide insights into reprogramming mechanisms and suggest new routes to more efficient reprogramming while minimizing the use of oncogenes.},

This architecture is obscured by the high density of components in most nuclei. We have developed a method of spreading nuclei and nucleoli that reduces overlap of weakly associated components. Strong interactions among nuclear components are not disrupted by this method. Spread nucleoli remained structurally distinct and functionally competent in ribosomal RNA synthesis. Nascent ribosomal RNA colocalized with RNA polymerase I and fibrillarin, a protein required for processing of ribosomal RNA. Colocalization of nascent transcripts and fibrillarin was seen in nucleoli spread over several microns, suggesting a strong interaction. These data suggest that nucleoli are superassemblies of bipartite domains, each composed of a ribosomal RNA synthesis center tightly associated with areas likely to be involved in ribosomal RNA processing.},

Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "Structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live in a post-Kuhnian age." -Mary Ellen Curtin},

abstract = {Although human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) has been widely studied, relatively little work has been done with other human adenovirus serotypes. The Ad5 E4orf6 and E1B55K proteins form Cul5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes to degrade p53, Mre11, DNA ligase IV, integrin $\alpha$3, and almost certainly other targets, presumably to optimize the cellular environment for viral replication and perhaps to facilitate persistence or latency. As this complex is essential for the efficient replication of Ad5, we undertook a systematic analysis of the structure and function of corresponding E4orf6/E1B55K complexes from other serotypes to determine the importance of this E3 ligase throughout adenovirus evolution. E4orf6 and E1B55K coding sequences from serotypes representing all subgroups were cloned, and each pair was expressed and analyzed for their capacity to assemble the Cullin-based ligase complex and to degrade substrates following plasmid DNA transfection. The results indicated that all formed Cullin-based E3 ligase complexes but that heterogeneity in both structure and function existed. Whereas Cul5 was present in the complexes of some serotypes, others recruited primarily Cul2, and the Ad16 complex clearly bound both Cul2 and Cul5. There was also heterogeneity in substrate specificity. Whereas all serotypes tested appeared to degrade DNA ligase IV, complexes from some serotypes failed to degrade Mre11, p53, or integrin $\alpha$3. Thus, a major evolutionary pressure for formation of the adenovirus ligase complex may lie in the degradation of DNA ligase IV; however, it seems possible that the degradation of as-yet-unidentified critical targets or, perhaps even more likely, appropriate combinations of substrates plays a central role for these adenoviruses.},

abstract = {Adenoviruses express up to 20 distinct mRNAs from five major late transcription unit (MLTU) regions, L1 to L5, by differential splicing and polyadenylation of the primary transcript. MLTU expression is regulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The L4-33K protein acts as a splicing factor to upregulate several MLTU splice acceptor sites as the late phase progresses. The L4 region also expresses a 22K protein whose sequence is related to the sequence of L4-33K. L4-22K is shown here also to have an important role in regulating the pattern of MLTU gene expression. An adenovirus genome containing a stop codon in the L4-22K open reading frame expressed low levels of both structural and nonstructural late proteins compared to the wild-type (wt) adenovirus genome; a decrease in intermediate proteins, IVa2 and IX, was also observed. However, early protein synthesis and replication were unaffected by the absence of L4-22K. Intermediate and late protein expression was restored to wt levels by L4-22K expressed in trans but not by L4-33K. Increased MLTU promoter activity, resulting from stabilization of the transcriptional activator IVa2 by L4-22K, made a small contribution to this restoration of late gene expression. However, the principal effect of L4-22K was on the processing of MLTU RNA into specific cytoplasmic mRNA. L4-22K selectively increased expression of penton mRNA and protein, whereas splicing to create penton mRNA is known not to be increased by L4-33K. These results indicate that L4-22K plays a key role in the early-late switch in MLTU expression, additional to and distinct from the role of L4-33K.},

abstract = {Cells infected by adenovirus E4 mutants accumulate end-to-end concatemers of the viral genome that are assembled from unit-length viral DNAs by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Genome concatenation can be prevented by expression either of E4 11k (product of E4orf3) or of the complex of E4 34k (product of E4orf6) and E1b 55k. Both E4 11k and the E4 34k/E1b 55k complex prevent concatenation at least in part by inactivation of the host protein Mre11: E4 11k sequesters Mre11 in aggresomes, while the E4 34k/E1b 55k complex participates in a virus-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The E4 34k/E1b 55k complex, but not E4 11k, also inhibits NHEJ activity on internal breaks in the viral genome and on V(D)J recombination substrate plasmids, suggesting that it may interfere with NHEJ independently of its effect on Mre11. We show here that DNA ligase IV, which performs the joining step of NHEJ, is degraded as a consequence of adenovirus infection. Degradation is dependent upon E4 34k and E1b 55k, functional proteasomes, and the activity of cellular cullin 5, a component of the adenoviral ubiquitin ligase. DNA ligase IV also interacts physically with E1b 55k. The data demonstrate that DNA ligase IV, like Mre11, is a substrate for the adenovirus-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase; identify an additional viral approach to prevention of genome concatenation; and provide a mechanism for the general inhibition of NHEJ by adenoviruses.},

abstract = {Nucleophosmin (NPM) (B23) is an essential protein in mouse development and cell growth; however, it has been assigned numerous roles in very diverse cellular processes. Here, we present a unified mechanism for NPM's role in cell growth; NPM directs the nuclear export of both 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. NPM interacts with rRNA and large and small ribosomal subunit proteins and also colocalizes with large and small ribosomal subunit proteins in the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The transduction of NPM shuttling-defective mutants or the loss of Npm1 inhibited the nuclear export of both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, reduced the available pool of cytoplasmic polysomes, and diminished overall protein synthesis without affecting rRNA processing or ribosome assembly. While the inhibition of NPM shuttling can block cellular proliferation, the dramatic effects on ribosome export occur prior to cell cycle inhibition. Modest increases in NPM expression amplified the export of newly synthesized rRNAs, resulting in increased rates of protein synthesis and indicating that NPM is rate limiting in this pathway. These results support the idea that NPM-regulated ribosome export is a fundamental process in cell growth.},

abstract = {Adenovirus infection induces a cellular DNA damage response that can inhibit viral DNA replication and ligate viral genomes into concatemers. It is not clear if the input virus is sufficient to trigger this response or if viral DNA replication is required. Adenovirus has evolved two mechanisms that target the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex to inhibit the DNA damage response. These include E4-ORF3-dependent relocalization of MRN proteins and E4-ORF6/E1B-55K-dependent degradation of MRN components. The literature suggests that degradation of the MRN complex due to E4-ORF6/E1B-55K does not occur until after viral DNA replication has begun. We show that, by the time viral DNA accumulates, the MRN complex is inactivated by either of the E4-induced mechanisms and that, with E4-ORF6/E1B-55K, this inactivation is due to MRN degradation. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that input viral DNA is sufficient to induce the DNA damage response. Further, we demonstrate that when the DNA damage response is active in E4 mutant virus infections, the covalently attached terminal protein is not cleaved from viral DNAs, and the viral origins of replication are not detectably degraded at a time corresponding to the onset of viral replication. The sequences of concatemeric junctions of viral DNAs were determined, which supports the conclusion that nonhomologous end joining mediates viral DNA ligation. Large deletions were found at these junctions, demonstrating nucleolytic procession of the viral DNA; however, the lack of terminal protein cleavage and terminus degradation at earlier times shows that viral genome deletion and concatenation are late effects.},

abstract = {The E1B-55-kDa protein of adenovirus type 5 and the p53 tumor suppressor gene product form a complex that localizes to the cytoplasm, thereby downregulating p53's transcriptional activity. The E4orf6 protein binds and relocalizes E1B-55-kDa, and the proteins act synergistically to inactivate p53. We show that another adenovirus E4 gene product, E4orf3, is also sufficient to relocalize E1B-55-kDa from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Both proteins are then found in discrete nuclear structures (tracks) that are known to contain components of the promyelocytic leukemia-associated nuclear structure. Simultaneously, p53 is dissociated from E1B-55-kDa and is found evenly distributed over the nucleoplasm. In the presence of E4orf3, p53-dependent transcriptional activity is no longer repressed by E1B-55-kDa. When E1B-55-kDa is coexpressed with E4orf3 and E4orf6, E1B-55-kDa is found to colocalize with E4orf6 rather than E4orf3. In parallel, p53 is inhibited and degraded by the combination of E1B-55-kDa and E4orf6, regardless of coexpressed E4orf3. This suggests that the effects of E4orf6 on E1B-55-kDa overrule the actions of E4orf3. When cells are infected with virus expressing E4orf3 but not E4orf6, E1B is found in the cell nucleus and p53 enters the virus replication centers. After infection with wild-type adenovirus, E4orf3 is expressed before E4orf6 and E1B temporarily colocalizes with E4orf3 in nuclear tracks before associating with E4orf6. We propose that during adenovirus infection, the E4orf3 protein transiently liberates p53 from its association with E1B-55-kDa. Subsequently, p53 is inactivated and degraded by the combination of E1B-55-kDa and E4orf6.},

abstract = {We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35\% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30\% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1\% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots.

abstract = {E3 ubiquitin ligases are a large family of proteins that are engaged in the regulation of the turnover and activity of many target proteins. Together with ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyze the ubiquitination of a variety of biologically significant protein substrates for targeted degradation through the 26S proteasome, as well as for nonproteolytic regulation of their functions or subcellular localizations. E3 ubiquitin ligases, therefore, play an essential role in the regulation of many biologic processes. Increasing amounts of evidence strongly suggest that the abnormal regulation of some E3 ligases is involved in cancer development. Furthermore, some E3 ubiquitin ligases are frequently overexpressed in human cancers, which correlates well with increased chemoresistance and poor clinic prognosis. In this review, E3 ubiquitin ligases (such as murine double minute 2, inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) will be evaluated as potential cancer drug targets and prognostic biomarkers. Extensive study in this field would lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism by which E3 ligases regulate cellular processes and of how their deregulations contribute to carcinogenesis. This would eventually lead to the development of a novel class of anticancer drugs targeting specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, as well as the development of sensitive biomarkers for cancer treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis.},

abstract = {Zebrafish carrying heterozygous mutations for 17 different ribosomal protein (rp) genes are prone to developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), a tumor type that is seldom seen in laboratory strains of zebrafish. Interestingly, the same rare tumor type arises in zebrafish that are homozygous for a loss-of-function point mutation in the tumor suppressor gene p53. For these reasons, and because p53 is widely known to be mutated in the majority of human cancers, we investigated the status of p53 in the rp(+/-) MPNSTs. Using monoclonal antibodies that we raised to zebrafish p53, we found that cells derived from rp(+/-) MPNSTs are significantly impaired in their ability to produce p53 protein even in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor and gamma-irradiation. Although the coding regions of the p53 gene remain wild type, the gene is transcribed, and overall protein production rates appear normal in rp(+/-) MPNST cells, p53 protein does not get synthesized. This defect is observed in all MPNSTs we examined that were derived from our 17 zebrafish lines with rp gene mutations. To date, studies of p53 in malignancies have focused predominantly on either p53 gene mutations or the aberrant posttranslational regulation of the p53 protein. Our results show that the appropriate amount of numerous ribosomal proteins is required for p53 protein production in vivo and that disruption of this regulation most likely contributes to tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53 is activated in response to many forms of cellular stress leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. Appropriate sub-cellular localization is essential for modulating p53 function. We recently showed that p53 localizes to the nucleolus after proteasome inhibition with MG132 and this localization requires sequences within its carboxyl terminus. In the present study, we found that after treatment with MG132, p53 associates with a discrete sub-nucleolar component, the fibrillar center (FC), a region mainly enriched with RNA polymerase I. Moreover, we now demonstrate that this localization is an energy-dependent process as reduction of ATP levels prevents nucleolar localization. In addition, p53 sub-nucleolar accumulation is abolished when cells are subjected to various types of genotoxic stress. Furthermore, we show that monoubiquitination of p53, which causes it to localize to the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, does not prevent the association of p53 with the nucleolus after MG132 treatment. Importantly, we demonstrate that p53 nucleolar association occurs in lung and bladder carcinomas.},

During latency the virus persists until reactivation, which leads to recurrent productive infection and transmission to a new host. How does HSV undergo such different types of infection in different cell types? Recent research indicates that regulation of the assembly of chromatin on HSV DNA underlies the lytic versus latent decision of HSV. We propose a model for the decision to undergo a lytic or a latent infection in which HSV encodes gene products that modulate chromatin structure towards either euchromatin or heterochromatin, and we discuss the implications of this model for the development of therapeutics for HSV infections.},

A-->I RNA editing was long thought to affect only selected transcripts by altering the proteins they encode. However, genome-wide screening has revealed numerous editing sites within inverted Alu repeats in introns and untranslated regions. Also, recent evidence indicates that A-->I RNA editing crosstalks with RNA-interference pathways, which, like A-->I RNA editing, involve dsRNAs. A-->I RNA editing therefore seems to have additional functions, including the regulation of retrotransposons and gene silencing, which adds a new urgency to the challenges of fully understanding ADAR functions.},

abstract = {Although adenovirus early region 1A (AdE1A) can modulate protein expression through its interaction with transcriptional regulators it can also influence the ability of the cell to degrade proteins by binding to components of the 26 S proteasome. We demonstrate here that AdE1A interacts with the S2 subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex in addition to the ATPase subunits S4 and S8 previously identified. S2 forms complexes with both the 13 and 12 S AdE1A proteins both in vivo and in vitro. Mutational analysis has shown direct binding through a short sequence toward the N terminus of conserved region 2 of AdE1A, which encompasses the LXCXE motif, involved in interaction with the pRb family of proteins. In vivo, additional contacts are made between AdE1A and proteasomal components, as well as within the proteasome, such that deletion of the N-terminal region of E1A as well as part of conserved region 2 is required to completely disrupt S2 binding. Mutation of AdE1A, which disrupts complex formation with S2, results in the loss of its ability to stabilize the p53 protein. Similarly down-regulation of S2 expression using small interfering RNAs leads to the inhibition of p53 degradation. These effects were observed in normally growing cells and those subjected to UV irradiation. Furthermore, AdE1A had no effect on the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. We suggest therefore that interaction of AdE1A with S2, as well as with the ATPases S4 and S8, directly causes inhibition of proteasomal activity and consequent increase in the protein levels of p53.},

A virus, dl338, carrying a deletion within the coding region for the 55 kd product, was found to be cold-sensitive for growth. Accumulation of late viral mRNAs was more severely inhibited at 32 than at 37 degrees C in dl338-infected cells. The metabolism of late viral transcripts was analysed within the nucleus of dl338-infected cells at 32 degrees C. Late viral mRNAs failed to accumulate efficiently within a nuclear compartment defined by specific RNA extraction conditions. Normally, RNA accumulated within this operationally defined compartment after leaving the nuclear matrix and before associating with the nuclear envelope. These results indicate that the 55 kd polypeptide encoded by early region 1B facilitates an intranuclear step in the metabolism of viral mRNAs, resulting in improved transport of these RNAs to the cytoplasm.},

abstract = {Posttranslational protein modification with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is an important regulatory mechanism implicated in many cellular processes, including several of biomedical relevance. We report that inhibition of the proteasome leads to accumulation of proteins that are simultaneously conjugated to both SUMO and ubiquitin in yeast and in human cells. A similar accumulation of such conjugates was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubc4 ubc5 cells as well as in mutants lacking two RING finger proteins, Ris1 and Hex3/Slx5-Slx8, that bind to SUMO as well as to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4. In vitro, Hex3-Slx8 complexes promote Ubc4-dependent ubiquitylation. Together these data identify a previously unrecognized pathway that mediates the proteolytic down-regulation of sumoylated proteins. Formation of substrate-linked SUMO chains promotes targeting of SUMO-modified substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that SUMO conjugation can ultimately lead to inactivation of sumoylated substrates by polysumoylation and/or ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Simultaneous inhibition of both mechanisms leads to severe phenotypic defects.},

abstract = {The term apoptosis is proposed for a hitherto little recognized mechanism of controlled cell deletion, which appears to play a complementary but opposite role to mitosis in the regulation of animal cell populations. Its morphological features suggest that it is an active, inherently programmed phenomenon, and it has been shown that it can be initiated or inhibited by a variety of environmental stimuli, both physiological and pathological. The structural changes take place in two discrete stages. The first comprises nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation and breaking up of the cell into a number of membrane-bound, ultrastructurally well-preserved fragments. In the second stage these apoptotic bodies are shed from epithelial-lined surfaces or are taken up by other cells, where they undergo a series of changes resembling in vitro autolysis within phagosomes, and are rapidly degraded by lysosomal enzymes derived from the ingesting cells. Apoptosis seems to be involved in cell turnover in many healthy adult tissues and is responsible for focal elimination of cells during normal embryonic development. It occurs spontaneously in untreated malignant neoplasms, and participates in at least some types of therapeutically induced tumour regression. It is implicated in both physiological involution and atrophy of various tissues and organs. It can also be triggered by noxious agents, both in the embryo and adult animal.

Although our knowledge about the actin-based cellular functions and the molecules that regulate the G- to F-actin transition is growing, the structural aspects of the transition remain enigmatic. We created a model of F-actin using X-ray fibre diffraction intensities obtained from well oriented sols of rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin to 3.3 A in the radial direction and 5.6 A along the equator. Here we show that the G- to F-actin conformational transition is a simple relative rotation of the two major domains by about 20 degrees. As a result of the domain rotation, the actin molecule in the filament is flat. The flat form is essential for the formation of stable, helical F-actin. Our F-actin structure model provides the basis for understanding actin polymerization as well as its molecular interactions with actin-binding proteins.},

abstract = {The adenovirus type 5 mutant dl1520 was engineered previously to be completely defective for E1B-55K functions. Recently, this mutant (also known as ONYX-015) has been suggested to replicate preferentially in p53(-) and some p53(+) tumor cell lines but to be attenuated in primary cultured cells (C. Heise, A. Sampson-Johannes, A. Williams, F. McCormick, D. D. F. Hoff, and D. H. Kirn, Nat. Med. 3:639-645, 1997). It has been suggested that dl1520 might be used as a "magic bullet" that could selectively lyse tumor cells without harm to normal tissues. However, we report here that dl1520 replication is independent of p53 genotype and occurs efficiently in some primary cultured human cells, indicating that the mutant virus does not possess a tumor selectivity. Although it was not the sole host range determinant, p53 function did reduce dl1520 replication when analyzed in a cell line expressing temperature-sensitive p53 (H1299-tsp53) (K. L. Fries, W. E. Miller, and N. Raab-Traub, J. Virol. 70:8653-8659, 1996). As found earlier for other E1B-55K mutants in HeLa cells (Y. Ho, R. Galos, and J. Williams, Virology 122:109-124, 1982), dl1520 replication was temperature dependent in H1299 cells. When p53 function was restored at low temperature in H1299-tsp53 cells, it imposed a modest defect in viral DNA replication and accumulation of late viral cytoplasmic mRNA. However, in both H1299 and H1299-tsp53 cells, the defect in late viral protein synthesis appeared to be much greater than could be accounted for by the modest defects in late viral mRNA levels. We therefore propose that in addition to countering p53 function and modulating viral and cellular mRNA nuclear transport, E1B-55K also stimulates late viral mRNA translation.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that transcription and RNA processing are intimately coupled in vivo, although each process can occur independently in vitro. It is generally thought that polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) kinases are recruited near the transcription start site to overcome initial Pol II pausing events, and that stably bound kinases facilitate productive elongation and co-transcriptional RNA processing. Whereas most studies have focused on how RNA processing machineries take advantage of the transcriptional apparatus to efficiently modify nascent RNA, here we report that a well-studied splicing factor, SC35, affects transcriptional elongation in a gene-specific manner. SC35 depletion induces Pol II accumulation within the gene body and attenuated elongation, which are correlated with defective P-TEFb (a complex composed of CycT1-CDK9) recruitment and dramatically reduced CTD Ser2 phosphorylation. Recombinant SC35 is sufficient to rescue this defect in nuclear run-on experiments. These findings suggest a reciprocal functional relationship between the transcription and splicing machineries during gene expression.},

@book{Dawkins1976,
abstract = {Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of The Selfish Gene. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since. Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or memes, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. -Rob Lightner Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters. One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world. The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.},

abstract = {Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutants impaired in the activities of the structural protein VP16 and the immediate-early (IE) proteins ICP0 and ICP4 establish a quiescent infection in human fibroblasts, with most cells retaining an inactive, repressed viral genome for sustained periods in culture. To date, the quiescent state has been considered stable, since it has been reversed only by provision of herpesviral proteins, such as ICP0, not by alteration of the cell physiological state. We report that the interaction of HSV-1 with human fibroblasts can be altered significantly by transient treatment of cultures with sodium arsenite, an inducer of heat shock and oxidative stress, or gramicidin D, a toxin that selectively permeabilizes cell membranes, prior to infection. These regimens stimulated gene expression from IE-deficient HSV-1 mutants in a promoter sequence-independent manner and also overcame the replication defect of ICP0-null mutants. Reactivation of gene expression from quiescent HSV-1 genomes and the resumption of virus replication were observed following addition of arsenite or gramicidin D to cultures. Both agents induced reorganization of nuclear domain 10 structures, the sites of quiescent genomes, but appeared to do so through different mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the physiological state of the cell is important in determining the outcome of infection with IE-deficient HSV-1 and show novel methods for reactivating quiescent HSV-1 in fibroblasts with a high efficiency.},

@article{Goodrum1999,
abstract = {Adenoviruses bearing lesions in the E1B 55-kDa protein (E1B 55-kDa) gene are restricted by the cell cycle such that mutant virus growth is most impaired in cells infected during G(1) and least restricted in cells infected during S phase (F. D. Goodrum and D. A. Ornelles, J. Virol. 71:548-561, 1997). A similar defect is reported here for E4 orf6-mutant viruses. An E4 orf3-mutant virus was not restricted for growth by the cell cycle. However, orf3 was required for enhanced growth of an E4 orf6-mutant virus in cells infected during S phase. The cell cycle restriction may be linked to virus-mediated mRNA transport because both E1B 55-kDa- and E4 orf6-mutant viruses are defective at regulating mRNA transport at late times of infection. Accordingly, the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of late viral mRNA was reduced in G(1) cells infected with the mutant viruses compared to that in G(1) cells infected with the wild-type virus. By contrast, this ratio was equivalent among cells infected during S phase with the wild-type or mutant viruses. Furthermore, cells infected during S phase with the E1B 55-kDa- or E4 orf6-mutant viruses synthesized more late viral protein than did cells infected during G(1). However, the total amount of cytoplasmic late viral mRNA was greater in cells infected during G(1) than in cells infected during S phase with either the wild-type or mutant viruses, indicating that enhanced transport of viral mRNA in cells infected during S phase cannot account for the difference in yields in cells infected during S phase and in cells infected during G(1). Thus, additional factors affect the cell cycle restriction. These results indicate that the E4 orf6 and orf3 proteins, in addition to the E1B 55-kDa protein, may cooperate to promote cell cycle-independent adenovirus growth.},

abstract = {Adenovirus continues to be an important model system for investigating basic aspects of cell biology. Interactions of several cellular proteins with E1A conserved regions (CR) 1 and 2, and inhibition of apoptosis by E1B proteins are required for oncogenic transformation. CR2 binds RB family members, de-repressing E2F transcription factors, thus activating genes required for cell cycling. E1B-19K is a BCL2 homolog that binds and inactivates proapoptotic BAK and BAX. E1B-55K binds p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activation function. In productively infected cells, E1B-55K and E4orf6 assemble a ubiquitin ligase with cellular proteins Elongins B and C, Cullin 5 and RBX1 that polyubiquitinates p53 and one or more subunits of the MRN complex involved in DNA double-strand break repair, directing them to proteosomal degradation. E1A CR3 activates viral transcription by interacting with the MED23 Mediator subunit, stimulating preinitiation complex assembly on early viral promoters and probably also the rate at which they initiate transcription. The viral E1B-55K/E4orf6 ubiquitin ligase is also required for efficient viral late protein synthesis in many cell types, but the mechanism is not understood. E1A CR1 binds several chromatin-modifying complexes, but how this contributes to stimulation of cellular DNA synthesis and transformation is not clear. E1A CR4 binds the CtBP corepressor, but the mechanism by which this modulates the frequency of transformation remains to be determined. Clearly, adenovirus has much left to teach us about fundamental cellular processes.},

abstract = {During a productive infection, species C adenovirus reprograms the host cell to promote viral translation at the expense of cellular translation. The E1B 55-kilodalton (E1B-55K) and E4 open reading frame 6 (E4orf6) proteins are important in this control of gene expression. As part of a ubiquitin-protein ligase, these viral proteins stimulate viral mRNA export, inhibit cellular mRNA export, promote viral gene expression, and direct the degradation of certain host proteins. We report here that the E1B-55K and E4orf6 proteins limited phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and the activation of the eIF2alpha kinase PKR. Phospho-eIF2alpha levels were observed to rise and fall at least twice during infection. The E1B-55K and E4orf6 proteins prevented a third increase at late times of infection. PKR appeared to phosphorylate eIF2alpha only in the absence of E1B-55K/E4orf6 function. PKR activation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation was unrelated to the cytoplasmic levels of the adenovirus inhibitor of PKR, VA-I RNA. Nonetheless, expression of a PKR inhibitor, the reovirus double-stranded RNA-binding protein sigma 3, prevented PKR activation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The sigma 3 protein largely corrected the defect in viral late protein synthesis associated with the E1B-55K and E4orf6 mutant viruses without affecting cytoplasmic levels of the late viral mRNA. The ubiquitin-protein ligase activity associated with the E1B-55K/E4orf6 complex was necessary to prevent activation of PKR and phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. These findings reveal a new contribution of the E1B-55K/E4orf6 complex to viral late protein synthesis and the existence of multiple layers of regulation imposed on eIF2alpha phosphorylation and PKR activation in adenovirus-infected cells.},

abstract = {The human adenovirus E4orf6 and E1B55K proteins promote viral replication by targeting several cellular proteins for degradation. The E4orf6 product has been shown by our group and others to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that contains elongins B and C and cullin family member Cul5. E1B55K associates with this complex, where it is believed to function primarily to introduce bound substrates for degradation via proteasomes. In addition to p53, its first known substrate, the E4orf6/E1B 55-kDa complex (E4orf6/E1B55K) was shown to promote the degradation of Mre11 and DNA ligase IV; however, additional substrates are believed to exist. This notion is strengthened by the fact that none of these substrates seems likely to be associated with additional functions shown to be mediated by the E4orf6-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, including export of late viral mRNAs and blockage of export of the bulk cellular mRNAs from the nucleus. In an attempt to identify new E4orf6/E1B55K substrates, we undertook a proteomic screen using human p53-null, non-small-cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells expressing either E4orf6 protein alone or in combination with E1B55K through infection by appropriate adenovirus vectors. One cellular protein that appeared to be degraded by E1B55K in combination with the E4orf6 protein was a species of molecular mass approximately 130 kDa that was identified as the integrin alpha3 subunit (i.e., very late activation antigen 3 alpha subunit).

Several mechanisms ensure this fidelity, including specialized surveillance pathways that rid the cell of mRNAs that are incompletely processed or that lack complete open reading frames. One such mechanism, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, is triggered when ribosomes encounter a premature translation-termination--or nonsense--codon. New evidence indicates that the specialized factors that are recruited for this process not only promote rapid mRNA degradation, but are also required to resolve a poorly dissociable termination complex.},

DesT bound to unsaturated acyl-CoA has a high affinity for its cognate palindromic DNA-binding site, whereas DesT bound to saturated acyl-CoA does not bind this site. Structural analyses of the DesT-oleoyl-CoA-DNA and DesT-palmitoyl-CoA complexes reveal that acyl chain shape directly influences the packing of hydrophobic core residues within the DesT ligand-binding domain. These changes are propagated to the paired DNA-binding domains via conformational changes to modulate DNA binding. These structural interpretations are supported by the in vitro and in vivo characterization of site-directed mutants. The regulation of DesT by the unsaturated:saturated ratio of acyl chains rather than the concentration of a single ligand is a paradigm for understanding transcriptional regulation of membrane lipid homeostasis.},

abstract = {We have studied in HeLa cells at the electron microscope level the response to adenovirus infection of the RNA processing machinery. Components of the spliceosomes were localized by in situ hybridization with biotinylated U1 and U2 DNA probes and by immunolabeling with Y12 anti-Sm monoclonal antibody, whereas poly(A)+ RNAs were localized by specific binding of biotinylated poly(dT) probe. At early stages of nuclear transformation, the distribution of small nuclear RNPs was similar to that previously described in non-infected nuclei (Visa, N., Puvion-Dutilleul, F., Bachellerie, J.P. and Puvion, E., Eur. J. Cell Biol. 60, 308-321, 1993; Visa, N., Puvion-Dutilleul, F., Harper, F., Bachellerie, J. P. and Puvion, E., Exp. Cell Res. 208, 19-34, 1993). As the infection progresses, the large virus-induced inclusion body consists of a central storage site of functionally inactive viral genomes surrounded by a peripheral shell formed by clusters of interchromatin granules, compact rings and a fibrillogranular network in which are embedded the viral single-stranded DNA accumulation sites. Spliceosome components and poly(A)+ RNAs were then exclusively detected over the clusters of interchromatin granules and the fibrillogranular network whereas the viral single-stranded DNA accumulation sites and compact rings remained unlabeled, thus appearing to not be directly involved in splicing. Our data, therefore, suggest that the fibrillogranular network, in addition to being the site of viral transcription, is also a major site of viral RNA splicing. Like the clusters of interchromatin granules, which had been already involved in spliceosome assembly, they could also have a role in the sorting of viral spliced polyadenylated mRNAs before export to the cytoplasm. The compact rings, which contain non-polyadenylated viral RNA, might accumulate the non-used portions of the viral transcripts resulting from differential poly(A)+ site selection.},

abstract = {During the adenovirus infectious cycle, the early proteins E4orf6 and E1B55K are known to perform several functions. These include nuclear export of late viral mRNAs, a block of nuclear export of the bulk of cellular mRNAs, and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of selected proteins, including p53 and Mre11. Degradation of these proteins occurs via a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is assembled through interactions between elongins B and C and BC boxes present in E4orf6 to form a cullin 5-based ligase complex. E1B55K, which has been known for some time to associate with the E4orf6 protein, is thought to bind to specific substrate proteins to bring them to the complex for ubiquitination. Earlier studies with E4orf6 mutants indicated that the interaction between the E4orf6 and E1B55K proteins is optimal only when E4orf6 is able to form the ligase complex. These and other observations suggested that most if not all of the functions ascribed to E4orf6 and E1B55K during infection, including the control of mRNA export, are achieved through the degradation of specific substrates by the E4orf6 ubiquitin ligase activity. We have tested this hypothesis through the generation of a virus mutant in which the E4orf6 product is unable to form a ligase complex and indeed have found that this mutant behaves identically to an E4orf6(-) virus in production of late viral proteins, growth, and export of the late viral L5 mRNA.},

abstract = {It is well established that the human subgroup C adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) E1B 55 kDa protein can regulate the activity and concentration of the cellular tumor suppressor, p53. However, the contribution(s) of these functions of the E1B protein to viral reproduction remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we examined properties of p53 in normal human cells infected by E1B mutant viruses that display defective entry into the late phase or viral late mRNA export. The steady-state concentrations of p53 were significantly higher in cells infected by the E1B 55 kDa null mutant Hr6 or three mutants carrying small insertions in the E1B 55 kDa protein coding sequence than in Ad5-infected cells. Nevertheless, none of the mutants induced apoptosis in infected cells. Rather, the localization of p53 to E1B containing nuclear sites observed during infection by Ad5 was prevented by mutations that impair interaction of the E1B protein with p53 and/or with the E4 Orf6 protein. These results indicate that the E1B protein fulfills an early function that correlates efficient entry into the late phase with the localization of E1B and p53 in the nucleus of Ad5-infected normal human cells.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a novel strategy that simplifies the generation and production of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) mutants carrying defined mutations in early transcription units 1 (E1) and 4 (E4). The strategy involves three recombinant plasmids containing E1 (pE1-1235), E4 (pE4-1155), or the wild-type genome that lacks a portion of E3 (pH5pg4100). To generate recombinant viruses, mutations are first introduced into pE1- and/or pE4-transfer plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenized constructs are then ligated into plasmid pH5pg4100 containing the Ad backbone by direct cloning. Infectious viral DNAs are released from the recombinant plasmids by PacI-digestion and transfected into the complementing cell lines 293 or W162, and viral progeny are isolated and amplified. The advantages of this strategy are multiple: all cloning steps are carried out in Escherichia coli, and any genetic region of the viral E1 and/or E4 transcription units can be specifically modified or deleted. Moreover, foreign genes can be introduced into the E1 and/or E4 regions, and expression of viral or therapeutic genes can be controlled by cell-type specific and/or inducible promoters.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the spatial organization of large scale chromatin domains in chinese hamster fibroblast, human lymphoid (IM-9), and marsupial kidney epithelial (PtK) cells by labeling DNA at defined stages of S phase via pulsed incorporation of halogenated deoxynucleosides. Most, if not all, chromosomes contribute multiple chromatin domains to both peripheral and internal nucleoplasmic compartments. The peripheral compartment contains predominantly late replicating G/Q bands, whereas early replicating R bands preferentially localize to the internal nucleoplasmic compartment. During mitosis, the labeled chromatin domains that were separated in interphase form a pattern of intercalated bands along the length of each metaphase chromosome. The transition from a banded (mitotic) to a compartmentalized (interphasic) organization of chromatin domains occurs during the late telophase/early G1 stage and is independent of transcriptional activation of the genome. Interestingly, generation of micronuclei with a few chromosomes showed that the spatial separation of early and late replicating chromatin compartments is recapitulated independently of chromosome number, even in micronuclei containing only a single chromosome. Our data strongly support the notion that the compartmentalization of large-scale (band size) chromatin domains seen in the intact nucleus is a magnified image of a similar compartmentalization occurring in individual chromosome territories.},

abstract = {Replication-defective human adenovirus (Ad) group C transducing vectors, most of which have the E1A, E1B, and E3 genes deleted, are highly inflammatory despite the fact that the parental viruses typically cause subclinical or mild infections. To investigate this paradox, the roles that the E1A, E1B, and E3 genes play in inflammation were tested by using replication-incompetent viruses carrying a deletion of the preterminal protein gene. The viruses were injected into BALB/c mouse ears, and edema was monitored as a sensitive surrogate marker of inflammation. A virus deleted for the E1A 289R (transcription activating) protein was noninflammatory, and inhibited edema induced by empty virus particles. The E1A 243R and E1B 55-kDa (p53 binding) proteins play the most important roles in inhibition of inflammation by the noninflammatory virus. The E1B 19-kDa antiapoptotic protein inhibited edema when both the E1A 243R and E1B 55-kDa proteins were expressed but strongly induced edema when only one was expressed. E3 proteins had their greatest effect on the inhibition of edema induced by the E1A 289R protein. The results support a model in which inflammation is countered through a mechanism that involves complex genetic interactions between Ad early region proteins and offer promise for the design and construction of noninflammatory Ad gene therapy vectors that are relatively easy to grow and purify.},

abstract = {Adenoviruses express up to 20 distinct mRNAs from five major late transcription unit (MLTU) regions, L1 to L5, by differential splicing and polyadenylation of the primary transcript. MLTU expression is regulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The L4-33K protein acts as a splicing factor to upregulate several MLTU splice acceptor sites as the late phase progresses. The L4 region also expresses a 22K protein whose sequence is related to the sequence of L4-33K. L4-22K is shown here also to have an important role in regulating the pattern of MLTU gene expression. An adenovirus genome containing a stop codon in the L4-22K open reading frame expressed low levels of both structural and nonstructural late proteins compared to the wild-type (wt) adenovirus genome; a decrease in intermediate proteins, IVa2 and IX, was also observed. However, early protein synthesis and replication were unaffected by the absence of L4-22K. Intermediate and late protein expression was restored to wt levels by L4-22K expressed in trans but not by L4-33K. Increased MLTU promoter activity, resulting from stabilization of the transcriptional activator IVa2 by L4-22K, made a small contribution to this restoration of late gene expression. However, the principal effect of L4-22K was on the processing of MLTU RNA into specific cytoplasmic mRNA. L4-22K selectively increased expression of penton mRNA and protein, whereas splicing to create penton mRNA is known not to be increased by L4-33K. These results indicate that L4-22K plays a key role in the early-late switch in MLTU expression, additional to and distinct from the role of L4-33K.},

@article{Yanagida1999,
abstract = {Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is fundamental to cell cycle progression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a mitotic cyclin (Cdc13), a key cell cycle regulator, is degraded for exiting mitosis, while Cut2 has to be destroyed for the onset of sister chromatid separation in anaphase. Ubiquitination of these proteins requires the special destruction box (DB) sequences locating in their N-termini and the large, 20S complex called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome. Here we show that cyclosome function during metaphase-anaphase progression is regulated by the protein kinase A (PKA) inactivation pathway, ubiquitination of the cyclosome subunit, and cellular localization of the target substrates. Evidence is provided that the cyclosome plays pleiotropic roles in the cell cycle: mutations in the subunit genes show a common anaphase defect, but subunit-specific phenotypes such as in G1/S or G2/M transition, septation and cytokinesis, stress response and heavy metal sensitivity, are additionally produced, suggesting that different subunits take distinct parts of complex cyclosome functions. Inactivation of PKA is important for the activation of the cyclosome for promoting anaphase, perhaps through dephosphorylation of the subunits such as Cut9 (Apc6). Cut4 (Apc1), the largest subunit, plays an essential role in the assembly and functional regulation of the cyclosome in response to cell cycle arrest and stresses. Cut4 is highly modified, probably by ubiquitination, when it is not assembled into the 20S cyclosome. Sds23 is implicated in DB-mediated ubiquitination possibly through regulating de-ubiquitination, while Cut8 is necessary for efficient proteolysis of Cdc13 and Cut2 coupled with cytokinesis. Unexpectedly, the timing of proteolysis is dependent on cellular localization of the substrate. Cdc13 enriched along the spindle disappears first, followed by decay of the nuclear signal, whereas Cut2 in the nucleus disappears first, followed by decline in the spindle signal during metaphase-anaphase progression.},

The binding of the dye to protein causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm, and it is the increase in absorption at 595 nm which is monitored. This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents. Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls.},

abstract = {Human adenovirus type 5 infection causes the disruption of structures in the cell nucleus termed promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein nuclear domains or ND10, which contain the PML protein as a critical component. This disruption is achieved through the action of the viral E4 Orf3 protein, which forms track-like nuclear structures that associate with the PML protein. This association is mediated by a direct interaction of Orf3 with a specific PML isoform, PMLII. We show here that the Orf3 interaction properties of PMLII are conferred by a 40 aa residue segment of the unique C-terminal domain of the protein. This segment was sufficient to confer interaction on a heterologous protein. The analysis was informed by prior application of a bioinformatic tool for the prediction of potential protein interaction sites within unstructured protein sequences (predictors of naturally disordered region analysis; PONDR). This tool predicted three potential molecular recognition elements (MoRE) within the C-terminal domain of PMLII, one of which was found to form the core of the Orf3 interaction site, thus demonstrating the utility of this approach. The sequence of the mapped Orf3-binding site on PML protein was found to be relatively poorly conserved across other species; however, the overall organization of MoREs within unstructured sequence was retained, suggesting the potential for conservation of functional interactions.},

Several protein inhibitors of the proteasome have also been identified, and the properties of these activators and inhibitors have been characterized biochemically. By contrast, their physiological roles--which have been reported to include production of antigenic peptides, proteasome assembly and DNA repair--are controversial.

@article{Nichols2009a,
abstract = {Adenovirus infection activates cellular DNA damage response and repair pathways. Viral proteins that are synthesized before viral DNA replication prevent recognition of viral genomes as a substrate for DNA repair by targeting members of the sensor complex composed of Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 for degradation and relocalization, as well as targeting the effector protein DNA ligase IV. Despite inactivation of these cellular sensor and effector proteins, infection results in high levels of histone 2AX phosphorylation, or gammaH2AX. Although phosphorylated H2AX is a characteristic marker of double-stranded DNA breaks, this modification was widely distributed throughout the nucleus of infected cells and was coincident with the bulk of cellular DNA. H2AX phosphorylation occurred after the onset of viral DNA replication and after the degradation of Mre11. Experiments with inhibitors of the serine-threonine kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), AT- and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK), the kinases responsible for H2AX phosphorylation, indicate that H2AX may be phosphorylated by ATR during a wild-type adenovirus infection, with some contribution from ATM and DNA-PK. Viral DNA replication appears to be the stimulus for this phosphorylation event, since infection with a nonreplicating virus did not elicit phosphorylation of H2AX. Infected cells also responded to high levels of input viral DNA by localized phosphorylation of H2AX. These results are consistent with a model in which adenovirus-infected cells sense and respond to both incoming viral DNA and viral DNA replication.},

abstract = {The morphology and composition of subnuclear organelles, such as Cajal bodies (CBs), nucleoli, and other nuclear bodies, is dynamic and can change in response to a variety of cell stimuli, including stress. We show that UV-C irradiation disrupts CBs and alters the distribution of a specific subset of CB components. The effect of UV-C on CBs differs from previously reported effects of transcription inhibitors. We demonstrate that the mechanism underlying the response of CBs to UV-C is mediated, at least in part, by PA28gamma (proteasome activator subunit gamma). The presence of PA28gamma in coilin-containing complexes is increased by UV-C. Overexpression of PA28gamma, in the absence of UV-C treatment, provokes a similar redistribution of the same subset of CB components that respond to UV-C. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PA28gamma attenuates the nuclear disruption caused by UV-C. These data demonstrate that CBs are specific nuclear targets of cellular stress-response pathways and identify PA28gamma as a novel regulator of CB integrity.},

abstract = {To investigate the mechanisms by which viral mRNA species are distinguished from their cellular counterparts for export to the cytoplasm during the late phase of subgroup C adenovirus infection, we have examined the metabolism of several cellular and viral mRNAs in human cells productively infected by adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Several cellular mRNAs that were refractory to, or could escape from, adenovirus-induced inhibition of export of mRNA from the nucleus have been identified. This group includes Hsp70 mRNAs synthesized upon heat shock of Ad5-infected 293 or HeLa cells during the late phase of infection. However, successful export in Ad5-infected cells is not a specific response to heat shock, for beta-tubulin and interferon-inducible mRNAs were also refractory to virus-induced export inhibition. The export of these cellular mRNAs, like that of viral late mRNAs, required the E1B 55-kDa protein. Export to the cytoplasm during the late phase of Ad5 infection of several cellular mRNAs, including members of the Hsp70 family whose export was inhibited under some, but not other, conditions, indicates that viral mRNA species cannot be selectively exported by virtue of specific sequence or structural features. Cellular and viral late mRNAs that can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm were expressed from genes whose transcription was induced or activated during the late phase of Ad5 infection. Consistent with the possibility that successful export is governed by transcriptional activation in the late phase of adenovirus infection, newly synthesized viral early E1A mRNA was subject to export inhibition during the late phase of infection.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which receptors guide intracellular virus transport are poorly characterized. The murine polyomavirus (Py) binds to the lipid receptor ganglioside GD1a and traffics to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it enters the cytosol and then the nucleus to initiate infection. How Py reaches the ER is unclear. We show that Py is transported initially to the endolysosome where the low pH imparts a conformational change that enhances its subsequent ER-to-cytosol membrane penetration. GD1a stimulates not viral binding or entry, but rather sorting of Py from late endosomes and/or lysosomes to the ER, suggesting that GD1a binding is responsible for ER targeting. Consistent with this, an artificial particle coated with a GD1a antibody is transported to the ER. Our results provide a rationale for transport of Py through the endolysosome, demonstrate a novel endolysosome-to-ER transport pathway that is regulated by a lipid, and implicate ganglioside binding as a general ER targeting mechanism.},

abstract = {A new approach to the important but difficult task of revealing possible human tumor viruses has been presented in this article. By systematic testing of already known human viruses for oncogenic properties, it was found that in hamsters injected intrapulmonarily with tissue culture fluid of human type 12 adenovirus within 24 hours after birth there was a very high incidence of malignant tumors at the site of injection in from 1 to 3 months. The tumorinducing activity was not lost by filtration through Selas 02 filters or by tissue culture passages in HeLa cells. Tumors thus induced grew in, and killed, a high percentage of the unconditioned young adult hamsters into which they were transplanted. No such tumors occurred in hamsters injected with control tissue culture fluid or with culture fluids of the other viruses tested, or in control breeder hamsters. The possibility that contamination with polyoma virus and simian virus 40 might be responsible for the tumors induced was specifically excluded by a variety of tests. The possible involvement of still other, as yet unknown, contaminant viruses was excluded by a positive association of the tumor-inducing ability with the adenovirus content. Of eight human sera tested, only those four which neutralized the adenovirus-type cytopathic effect also neutralized the tumor-inducing effect. Of 700 human sera tested, 26 percent contained CPE-neutralizing antibodies for type 12 adenovirus at titers of 1:4 and higher (23).},

abstract = {Viruses have been linked to approximately 20\% of all human tumors worldwide. These transforming viruses encode viral oncoproteins that interact with cellular proteins to enhance viral replication. The transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of these viral oncoproteins ultimately result in cellular transformation. Historically, viral research has been vital to the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressors with more current research aiding in unraveling some mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Interestingly, since transforming viruses affect some of the same pathways that are dysregulated in human cancers, their study enhances our understanding of the multistep process of tumorigenesis. This review will examine the cellular mechanisms targeted by oncogenic human viruses and the processes by which these effects contribute to transformation. In particular, we will focus on three transforming viruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type-I, hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus. These viruses all encode specific oncogenes that promote cell cycle progression, inhibit DNA damage checkpoint responses and prevent programmed cell death in an effort to promote viral propagation. While the transforming properties of these viruses are probably unintended consequences of replication strategies, they provide excellent systems in which to study cancer development.},

abstract = {The reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotent cells (induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) is known to be an inefficient process. We recently reported that cells with short telomeres cannot be reprogrammed to iPS cells despite their normal proliferation rates, probably reflecting the existence of 'reprogramming barriers' that abort the reprogramming of cells with uncapped telomeres. Here we show that p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) is critically involved in preventing the reprogramming of cells carrying various types of DNA damage, including short telomeres, DNA repair deficiencies, or exogenously inflicted DNA damage. Reprogramming in the presence of pre-existing, but tolerated, DNA damage is aborted by the activation of a DNA damage response and p53-dependent apoptosis. Abrogation of p53 allows efficient reprogramming in the face of DNA damage and the generation of iPS cells carrying persistent DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations. These observations indicate that during reprogramming cells increase their intolerance to different types of DNA damage and that p53 is critical in preventing the generation of human and mouse pluripotent cells from suboptimal parental cells.},

abstract = {Adenovirus e1a induces quiescent human cells to replicate. We found that e1a causes global relocalization of the RB (retinoblastoma) proteins (RB, p130, and p107) and p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases on promoters, the effect of which is to restrict the acetylation of histone 3 lysine-18 (H3K18ac) to a limited set of genes, thereby stimulating cell cycling and inhibiting antiviral responses and cellular differentiation. Soon after expression, e1a binds transiently to promoters of cell cycle and growth genes, causing enrichment of p300/CBP, PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), and H3K18ac; depletion of RB proteins; and transcriptional activation. e1a also associates transiently with promoters of antiviral genes, causing enrichment for RB, p130, and H4K16ac; increased nucleosome density; and transcriptional repression. At later times, e1a and p107 bind mainly to promoters of development and differentiation genes, repressing transcription. The temporal order of e1a binding requires its interactions with p300/CBP and RB proteins. Our data uncover a defined epigenetic reprogramming leading to cellular transformation.},

abstract = {Synthesis of progeny DNA genomes in cells infected by human subgroup C adenoviruses leads to several changes in viral gene expression. These changes include transcription from previously silent, late promoters, such as the IV(a2) promoter, and a large increase in the efficiency of major-late (ML) transcription. Some of these changes appear to take place sequentially, because the product of the IV(a2) gene has been implicated in stimulation of ML transcription. Our previous biochemical studies suggested that IV(a2) transcription is regulated by viral DNA synthesis-dependent relief of transcriptional repression by a cellular protein that we termed IV(a2)-RF. To test the relevance of such a repressor-titration mechanism during the viral infectious cycle, we introduced into the endogenous IV(a2) promoter two mutations that impair in vitro-binding of IV(a2)-RF, but introduce no change (Rep7) or one conservative amino acid substitution (Rep6) into the overlapping coding sequence for the viral DNA polymerase. The results of run-on transcription assays indicated that both mutations induced earlier-than-normal and more efficient IV(a2) transcription. Both mutations were also observed to result in modest increases in the efficiency of viral DNA synthesis. However, measurement of the concentration of IV(a2) transcripts as a function of IV(a2) template concentration demonstrated that the Rep mutations increased by up to 60-fold the efficiency with which IV(a2) templates were used during the initial period of the late phase of infection, as predicted by the repressor titration hypothesis. These mutations also increased the efficiency of ML transcription in infected cells.},

Although some evidence supports a role of SUMO modification in regulating protein stability, most studied examples support a model by which SUMO alters the interaction properties of its targets, often affecting their subcellular localization behavior. Examination of the PML nuclear bodies, whose principal components are SUMO-modified, has revealed this modification to be essential for their structural and functional integrity. This and other examples thus support the view that SUMO regulates the stability not of individual proteins, but rather that of entire multiprotein complexes.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) and other high-risk HPVs are etiologically linked to the development of cervical carcinomas and contribute to a number of other tumors of the anogenital tract, as well as oral cancers. The high-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins are consistently expressed in cervical cancer cells and are necessary for the induction and maintenance of the transformed phenotype. An important aspect of HPV16 E7's oncogenic activities is destabilization of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRB) through a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism, although the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we report that HPV16 E7 is associated with an enzymatically active cullin 2 ubiquitin ligase complex and that the HPV16 E7/pRB complex contains cullin 2. Depletion of cullin 2 by RNA interference causes increased steady-state levels and stability of pRB in HPV16 E7-expressing cells, and ectopic expression of HPV16 E7 and the cullin 2 complex leads to pRB ubiquitination in vivo. Hence, we propose that the HPV16 E7-associated cullin 2 ubiquitin ligase complex contributes to aberrant degradation of the pRB tumor suppressor in HPV16 E7-expressing cells.},

Furthermore, a short region of the AAV5 capsid gene RNA leader sequence surrounding the AUG of VP1 could induce the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Both short interfering RNA directed against PKR and the addition of the herpes simplex virus ICP34.5 protein enhanced the accumulation of AAV5 capsid protein in the presence of the AAV5 capsid gene PKR-inducing element, suggesting that VA RNA acted to overcome direct AAV5-induced activation of PKR that led to the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. The expression of both the closely related goat-derived AAV and the prototype AAV2 capsid gene transcription units also induced the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, suggesting that the induction of the PKR/eIF2alpha cellular response may be a previously unrecognized general feature of at least the Dependovirus genus of the Parvovirinae.},

abstract = {The E1B-55K product from human adenovirus is a substrate of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugation system. SUMOylation of E1B-55K is required to transform primary mammalian cells in cooperation with adenovirus E1A and to repress p53 tumour suppressor functions. The biochemical consequences of SUMO1 conjugation of 55K have so far remained elusive. Here, we report that E1B-55K physically interacts with different isoforms of the tumour suppressor protein promyelocytic leukaemia (PML). We show that E1B-55K binds to PML isoforms IV and V in a SUMO1-dependent and -independent manner. Interaction with PML-IV promotes the localization of 55K to PML-containing subnuclear structures (PML-NBs). In virus-infected cells, this process is negatively regulated by other viral proteins, indicating that binding to PML is controlled through reversible SUMOylation in a timely coordinated manner. These results together with earlier work are consistent with the idea that SUMOylation regulates targeting of E1B-55K to PML-NBs, known to control transcriptional regulation, tumour suppression, DNA repair and apoptosis. Furthermore, they suggest that SUMO1-dependent modulation of p53-dependent growth suppression through E1B-55K PML-IV interaction has a key role in adenovirus-mediated cell transformation.},

abstract = {The human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) E4orf4 product has been studied extensively although in most cases as expressed from vectors in the absence of other viral products. Thus, relatively little is known about its role in the context of an adenovirus infection. Although considerable earlier work had indicated that the E4orf4 protein is not essential for replication, a recent study using dl359, an Ad5 mutant believed to produce a nonfunctional E4orf4 protein, suggested that E4orf4 is essential for virus growth in primary small-airway epithelial cells (C. O'Shea, et al., EMBO J. 24:1211-1221, 2005). Hence, to examine further the role of E4orf4 during virus infection, we generated for the first time a set of E4orf4 virus mutants in a common Ad5 genetic background. Such mutant viruses included those that express E4orf4 proteins containing various individual point mutations, those defective entirely in E4orf4 expression, and a mutant expressing wild-type E4orf4 fused to the green fluorescent protein. E4orf4 protein was found to localize primarily in nuclear structures shown to be viral replication centers, in nucleoli, and in perinuclear bodies. Importantly, E4orf4 was shown not to be essential for virus growth in either human tumor or primary cells, at least in tissue culture. Unlike E4orf4-null virus, mutant dl359 appeared to exhibit a gain-of-function phenotype that impairs virus growth. The dl359 E4orf4 protein, which contains a large in-frame internal deletion, clustered in aggregates enriched in Hsp70 and proteasome components. In addition, the late viral mRNAs produced by dl359 accumulated abnormally in a nuclear punctate pattern. Altogether, our results indicate that E4orf4 protein is not essential for virus growth in culture and that expression of the dl359 E4orf4 product interferes with viral replication, presumably through interactions with structures in the nucleus.},

abstract = {Previous reports in various cells and species have shown that apoptotic cells are specifically and strongly labeled by certain c-Jun/N-terminal antibodies, such as c-Jun/sc45. This kind of immunoreactivity is confined to the cytoplasm. It is not due to c-Jun but appears to be related to c-Jun-like neoepitopes generated during apoptosis. This study was planned to gain further information about c-Jun-like immunostaining during apoptosis and to evaluate these antibodies as possible tools for characterizing cell death. Most of the experiments were performed in chick embryo spinal cord. When the apoptotic c-Jun-like immunoreactivity and caspase-3 immunostaining patterns were compared, we found that both antibodies immunostained the same dying cells in a similar pattern. In contrast to TUNEL staining, which reveals a positive reaction in both apoptotic and necrotic dying cells, active caspase-3 and c-Jun/sc45 antibodies are more selective because they stained only apoptotic cells. When cytosolic extracts from normal tissues were digested in vitro with caspase-3, c-Jun/sc45 immunoreactivity was strongly induced in several proteins, as demonstrated by Western blotting. Similar results were found when normal tissue sections were treated with caspase-3. Our results show that c-Jun/sc45 antibodies react with neoepitopes generated from cell proteins cleaved by activated caspases during apoptosis.

abstract = {Adenoviruses (Ad) with the early region E4 deleted (E4-deleted virus) are defective for DNA replication and late protein synthesis. Infection with E4-deleted viruses results in activation of a DNA damage response, accumulation of cellular repair factors in foci at viral replication centers, and joining together of viral genomes into concatemers. The cellular DNA repair complex composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 (MRN) is required for concatemer formation and full activation of damage signaling through the protein kinases Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-Rad3-related (ATR). The E4orf3 and E4orf6 proteins expressed from the E4 region of Ad type 5 (Ad5) inactivate the MRN complex by degradation and mislocalization, and prevent the DNA damage response. Here we investigated individual contributions of the MRN complex, concatemer formation, and damage signaling to viral DNA replication during infection with E4-deleted virus. Using virus mutants, short hairpin RNA knockdown and hypomorphic cell lines, we show that inactivation of MRN results in increased viral replication. We demonstrate that defective replication in the absence of E4 is not due to concatemer formation or DNA damage signaling. The C terminus of Nbs1 is required for the inhibition of Ad DNA replication and recruitment of MRN to viral replication centers. We identified regions of Nbs1 that are differentially required for concatemer formation and inhibition of Ad DNA replication. These results demonstrate that targeting of the MRN complex explains the redundant functions of E4orf3 and E4orf6 in promoting Ad DNA replication. Understanding how MRN impacts the adenoviral life cycle will provide insights into the functions of this DNA damage sensor.},

abstract = {An important negative control mechanism in the signaling of epidermal growth factor (EGF) is the endocytosis and subsequent degradation of activated EGF receptors. Eps15 and its related partner Eps15R play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transmembrane receptors. Upon EGF stimulation of the cell, Eps15 becomes both phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and monoubiquitinated. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 has been implicated in EGF receptor internalization, the function of Eps15 ubiquitination is not known. Using a mutational approach, we have found that the second ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) of Eps15 and Eps15R is essential for their ubiquitination. This UIM partially overlaps with the recently characterized nuclear export signal in Eps15. We show that these two overlapping motifs have different structural requirements with respect to nuclear export signal versus ubiquitination signal activity. Our data demonstrate that the UIM does not contain the ubiquitin acceptor site but functions as a recruitment site for the ubiquitination machinery leading to the monoubiquitination of both Eps15 and Eps15R.},

abstract = {The ability of the adenovirus type 5 E1B 55-kDa mutants dl1520 and dl338 to replicate efficiently and independently of the cell cycle, to synthesis viral DNA, and to lyse infected cells did not correlate with the status of p53 in seven cell lines examined. Rather, cell cycle-independent replication and virus-induced cell killing correlated with permissivity to viral replication. This correlation extended to S-phase HeLa cells, which were more susceptible to virus-induced cell killing by the E1B 55-kDa mutant virus than HeLa cells infected during G1. Wild-type p53 had only a modest effect on E1B mutant virus yields in H1299 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 allele. The defect in E1B 55-kDa mutant virus replication resulting from reduced temperature was as much as 10-fold greater than the defect due to p53 function. At 39 degreesC, the E1B 55-kDa mutant viruses produced wild-type yields of virus and replicated independently of the cell cycle. In addition, the E1B 55-kDa mutant viruses directed the synthesis of late viral proteins to levels equivalent to the wild-type virus level at 39 degreesC. We have previously shown that the defect in mutant virus replication can also be overcome by infecting HeLa cells during S phase. Taken together, these results indicate that the capacity of the E1B 55-kDa mutant virus to replicate independently of the cell cycle does not correlate with the status of p53 but is determined by yet unidentified mechanisms. The cold-sensitive nature of the defect of the E1B 55-kDa mutant virus in both late gene expression and cell cycle-independent replication leads us to speculate that these functions of the E1B 55-kDa protein may be linked.},

In this report we show that nuclear import of the major capsid protein, hexon, is mediated by protein VI, a structural protein located underneath the 12 vertices of the adenoviral capsid. Our data indicate that protein VI shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that it links hexon to the nuclear import machinery via an importin alpha/beta-dependent mechanism. Key nuclear import and export signals of protein VI are located in a short C-terminal segment, which is proteolytically removed during virus maturation. The removal of these C-terminal transport signals appears to trigger a functional transition in protein VI, from a role in supporting hexon nuclear import to a structural role in virus assembly.},

abstract = {The E1B-55K and E4orf6 oncoproteins of adenovirus type 5 are involved in the export of viral mRNAs. Previously, it was suggested that a complex composed of E1B-55K and E4orf6 serves as a nucleocytoplasmic transporter for viral mRNAs in which the E4orf6 protein directs both nuclear import and export. We now demonstrate that the E1B-55K protein itself shuttles efficiently in the absence of E4orf6. In addition, E1B-55K trafficking was independent of the defined shuttle proteins Mdm2 or p53, which interacts with E1B-55K. The identified N-terminal E1B-55K leucine-rich nuclear-export signal (NES) conferred rapid nuclear export even in a heterologous system in contrast to the postulated E4orf6NES. Interestingly, although shuttling was blocked by inhibitors of the CRM1 mediated export pathway, E1B-55K inhibited neither the activity nor the trafficking of the retroviral shuttle proteins HIV-1 Rev and HTLV-1 Rex. In contrast, Rev or Rex blocked the nuclear export of E1B-55K, most likely by competing for essential export factors. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of the adenovirus mRNA export system and the processes of adenovirus mediated transformation. Oncogene (2000) 19, 850 - 857.},

abstract = {The localization of the adenovirus type 5 34-kDa E4 and 55-kDa E1B proteins was determined in the absence of other adenovirus proteins. When expressed by transfection in human, monkey, hamster, rat, and mouse cell lines, the E1B protein was predominantly cytoplasmic and typically was excluded from the nucleus. When expressed by transfection, the E4 protein accumulated in the nucleus. Strikingly, when coexpressed by transfection in human, monkey, or baby hamster kidney cells, the E1B protein colocalized in the nucleus with the E4 protein. A complex of the E4 and E1B proteins was identified by coimmunoprecipitation in transfected HeLa cells. By contrast to the interaction observed in primate and baby hamster kidney cells, the E4 protein failed to direct the E1B protein to the nucleus in rat and mouse cell lines as well as CHO and V79 hamster cell lines. This failure of the E4 protein to direct the nuclear localization of the E1B protein in REF-52 rat cells was overcome by fusion with HeLa cells. Within 4 h of heterokaryon formation and with protein synthesis inhibited, a portion of the E4 protein present in the REF-52 nuclei migrated to the HeLa nuclei. Simultaneously, the previously cytoplasmic E1B protein colocalized with the E4 protein in both human and rat cell nuclei. These results suggest that a primate cell-specific factor mediates the functional interaction of the E1B and E4 proteins of adenovirus.},

abstract = {Most adenoviruses bind directly to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on target cells in vitro, but recent research has shown that adenoviruses can also use soluble components in body fluids for indirect binding to target cells. These mechanisms have been identified upon addressing the questions of how to de- and retarget adenovirus-based vectors for human gene and cancer therapy, but the newly identified mechanisms also suggest that the role of body fluids and their components may also be of importance for natural, primary infections. Here we demonstrate that plasma, saliva, and tear fluid promote binding and infection of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) in respiratory and ocular epithelial cells, which corresponds to the natural tropism of most adenoviruses, and that plasma promotes infection by Ad31. By using a set of binding and infection experiments, we also found that Ad5 and Ad31 require coagulation factors IX (FIX) or X (FX) or just FIX, respectively, for efficient binding and infection. The concentrations of these factors that were required for maximum binding were 1/100th of the physiological concentrations. Preincubation of virions with heparin or pretreatment of cells with heparinase I indicated that the role of cell surface heparan sulfate during FIX- and FX-mediated adenovirus binding and infection is mechanistically serotype specific. We conclude that the use of coagulation factors by adenoviruses may be of importance not only for the liver tropism seen when administering adenovirus vectors to the circulation but also during primary infections by wild-type viruses of their natural target cell types.},

abstract = {The adenoviral protein E4orf6 has been shown to inhibit both in vitro V(D)J recombination and adenoviral DNA concatenation, two processes that rely on cellular DNA double strand break repair (DSBR) proteins. Most of the known activities of E4orf6 during adenoviral infection require its interaction with another adenoviral protein, E1B-55K. Here we report that E4orf6, stably expressed in RKO human colorectal carcinoma cells or transiently expressed by adenoviral vector in U251 human glioblastoma cells, inhibits DSBR and induces significant radiosensitization in the absence of E1B-55K. Expression of a mutant form of E4orf6 (L245P) failed to radiosensitize RKO cells. E4orf6 reduced DSBR capacity in transfected and infected cells, as measured by sublethal DNA damage repair assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) levels, respectively. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of E4orf6 on DSBR, expression of wild-type but not mutant E4orf6 reduced recovery of a transfected, replicating reporter plasmid (pSP189) in 293 cells but did not increase the mutation frequency measured in the reporter plasmid. The kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) toward heterologous substrates was not affected by expression of E4orf6; however, autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 following ionizing radiation was prolonged in the presence of E4orf6 when compared with control-infected cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that E4orf6 expression hinders the cellular DNA repair process in mammalian cells in the absence of E1B-55K or other adenoviral genes and suggest that viral-mediated delivery of E4orf6, combined with localized external beam radiation, could be a useful approach for the treatment of radioresistant solid tumors such as glioblastomas.},

The results indicate that adenovirus infection induces the disassembly of coiled bodies and that this effect is probably secondary to the block of host protein synthesis induced by the virus. Furthermore, coiled bodies are shown to be very labile structures, with a half-life of approximately 2 h after treatment of HeLa cells with protein synthesis inhibitors. After blocking of protein synthesis, p80 coilin was detected in numerous microfoci that do not concentrate snRNP. These structures may represent precursor forms of the coiled body, which goes through a rapid cycle of assembly/disassembly in the nucleus and requires ongoing protein synthesis to reassemble.},

The compartmentalization and locus of separation of the pentameric B subunits (CTB) from the A subunit (CTA) of the toxin were evaluated on a pixel-by-pixel (voxel-by-voxel) basis by measuring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CTB labelled with the sulfoindocyanine dye Cy3 and an antibody against CTA labelled with Cy5. The FRET efficiency was determined by a new technique based on the release of quenching of the Cy3 donor after photodestruction of the Cy5 acceptor in a region of interest within the cell. The results demonstrate vesicular transport of the holotoxin from the plasma membrane to the Golgi compartment with subsequent separation of the CTA and CTB subunits. The CTA subunit is redirected to the plasma membrane by retrograde transport via the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the CTB subunit persists in the Golgi compartment.},

Transcription was monitored by high-resolution autoradiography after short pulses with tritiated uridine. At the earliest stage of virus-induced nuclear transformation, viral RNA was restricted to the small compact fibrillar "early replicative sites" which we had previously demonstrated to be the site of viral DNA replication (Puvion-Dutilleul and Puvion, 1990b). Protease-DNase-treated sections revealed that these fibrillar masses rapidly enlarged and gave rise to a juxtaposed loose fibrillogranular structure devoid of viral RNA. Subsequently, the function of the compact fibrillar zones changed to become the sites of accumulation of single-stranded (ss) viral DNA molecules, and the contiguous new fibrillogranular zones (previously named the peripheral replicative zones, Puvion-Dutilleul and Puvion, 1990a) became not only the centers of replicating viral double-stranded DNA but also the only sites of viral RNA molecules including the elongating RNA transcripts. Pulse-chase experiments revealed an unexpected accumulation of RNA molecules in these extranucleolar regions of infected nuclei.},

Previous studies have implicated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in the turnover of wild-type p53 but have not established whether or not p53 is itself a substrate of the ubiquitin system. In this study, inhibitors of the 26S proteasome have been used to further explore the role of ubiquitin proteolysis in regulating p53 turnover. Increased levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 were observed in normal cells, as well as in cells expressing the human papillomavirus 16 E6 oncoprotein, on exposure of the cells to proteasome inhibitors. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the increased p53 levels resulted from stabilization of the protein. Furthermore, ubiquitin-p53 conjugates were detected in untreated as well as gamma-irradiated cells, indicating that ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays a role in the normal turnover of p53. Increased levels of the cyclin:cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a downstream effector of p53 function, were also observed in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells, and this increase was due in part to an increase in p2l mRNA.},

abstract = {Interferons (IFNs) are a family of secreted proteins with antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities. The different biological actions of IFN are believed to be mediated by the products of specifically induced cellular genes in the target cells. The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein localizes both in the nucleoplasm and in matrix-associated multi-protein complexes known as nuclear bodies (NBs). PML is essential for the proper formation and the integrity of the NBs. Modification of PML by the Small Ubiquitin MOdifier (SUMO) was shown to be required for its localization in NBs. The number and the intensity of PML NBs increase in response to interferon (IFN). Inactivation of the IFN-induced PML gene by its fusion to retinoic acid receptor alpha alters the normal localization of PML from the punctuate nuclear patterns of NBs to micro-dispersed tiny dots and results in uncontrolled growth in Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia. The NBs-associated proteins, PML, Sp100, Sp140, Sp110, ISG20 and PA28 are induced by IFN suggesting that nuclear bodies could play a role in IFN response. Although the function of PML NBs is still unclear, some results indicate that they may represent preferential targets for viral infections and that PML could play a role in the mechanism of the antiviral action of IFNs. Viruses, which require the cellular machinery for their replication, have evolved different ways to counteract the action of IFN by inhibiting IFN signalling, by blocking the activities of specific antiviral mediators or by altering PML expression and/or localization on nuclear bodies.},

abstract = {In response to DNA damage, cells activate a complex protein network designed to sustain genomic integrity. Many of the proteins involved in the network form discrete repair foci, the composition of which is determined by the specific type of damage. Replication protein A (RPA) and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex both participate in foci and co-localize at certain types of lesions. Following etoposide (ETOP) treatment, cells form foci containing either RPA or the MRN complex, but not both. To investigate this preferential foci formation, we used cell cycle synchronization experimentation. We demonstrate that cells in S phase contain RPA foci but lack phospho-Nbs1 foci. This is consistent with RPA's role in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the predominant form of repair during S phase. Cells synchronized at G0/G1 phase contain phospho-Nbs1 foci, consistent with the MRN complex involvement in non-homologous end joining, the predominant form of repair in G1 phase. Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 dramatically reduced the percentage of cells forming phospho-Nbs1 foci but did not alter the percentage of cells containing RPA or phospho-RPA foci. ETOP induced similar amounts of damage in all phases of the cell cycle as measured by the comet assay. These data suggest that in response to DNA DSBs, cell cycle-preferred repair pathways differentially engage RPA and the MRN complex in repair foci.},

Trans-splicing was observed between viral RNA and several cellular precursor mRNAs, including beta-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Using a tetracycline-inducible model system simulating viral trans-splicing activity we observed that overexpression of a trans-splicing RNA specifically inhibited cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that heterologous trans-splicing occurs naturally during adenovirus infection and suggest that trans-splicing may contribute to disruption of cell function.},

This regulation occurs either at the level of individual targets, through an interplay between stress-induced phosphorylation and SUMOylation, or via modulation of the conjugation/deconjugation machinery abundance or activity. The present review gives an overview of the connections between stress and SUMOylation, the underlying molecular mechanisms and their effects on cellular functions.},

The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data.The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's Song of the Dodo to arguments in the professional literature, The Theory of Island Biogeography remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species.

abstract = {Adenovirus E1B 55K protein cooperates with E1A gene products to induce cell transformation. E1B 55K mediates its effects by binding to and inhibiting the transcriptional activation and growth-suppression functions of the tumor suppressor p53. Previous studies in vivo have suggested that E1B 55K has an active role in repressing p53 transcriptional activation and that this repression function is directed to specific promoters through E1B 55K's interaction with DNA-bound p53. Flag-tagged E1B 55K (e55K) was expressed with the baculovirus expression system and immunopurified. Gel filtration, velocity sedimentation centrifugation, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking indicated that e55K is a dimer with a nonglobular conformation. e55K bound directly to purified p53, causing an approximately 10-fold increase in p53 affinity for tandem binding sites. Using in vitro transcription assays reconstituted with purified p53, e55K, and HeLa cell nuclear extracts, we found that e55K specifically repressed p53 activation. These results demonstrate that as postulated from earlier transient expression experiments, E1B 55K is a specific repressor of transcription from a promoter with bound p53. Since HeLa nuclear extracts contain little detectable histone protein, E1B 55K probably represses transcription through direct or indirect interactions with the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery.},

abstract = {Clinical trials have shown oncolytic adenoviruses to be tumor selective with minimal toxicity toward normal tissue. The virus ONYX-015, in which the gene encoding the early region 1B 55-kDa (E1B-55K) protein is deleted, has been most effective when used in combination with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Therefore, improving the oncolytic nature of tumor-selective adenoviruses remains an important objective for improving this form of cancer therapy. Cells infected during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle with the E1B-55K deletion mutant virus exhibit a reduced rate of viral late protein synthesis, produce fewer viral progeny, and are less efficiently killed than cells infected during the S phase. Here we demonstrate that the G(1) restriction imposed on the E1B-55K deletion mutant virus is due to the viral oncogene encoded by open reading frame 1 of early region 4 (E4orf1). E4orf1 has been reported to signal through the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway leading to the activation of Akt, mTOR, and p70 S6K. Evidence presented here shows that E4orf1 may also induce the phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6K in a manner that depends on Rac1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1. Accordingly, agents that have been reported to disrupt the Tiam1-Rac1 interaction or to prevent phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 kinase partially alleviated the E4orf1 restriction to late viral protein synthesis and enhanced tumor cell killing by the E1B-55K mutant virus. These results demonstrate that E4orf1 limits the oncolytic nature of a conditionally replicating adenovirus such as ONYX-015. The therapeutic value of similar oncolytic adenoviruses may be improved by abrogating E4orf1 function.},

Two-dimensional gel analysis revealed changes in six proteins. By contrast, SILAC-based approaches identified 351 proteins with 24 proteins showing at least a 2-fold change after infection. Of those, four were previously reported to have aberrant localization and/or functional relevance during adenovirus infection. In total, 15 proteins identified as changing in amount by proteomics methods were examined in infected cells using confocal microscopy. Eleven of these proteins showed altered patterns of localization in adenovirus-infected cells. Comparing our data with the effects of actinomycin D on the nucleolar proteome revealed that adenovirus infection apparently specifically targets a relatively small subset of nucleolar antigens at the time point examined.},

abstract = {Transposons populate the landscape of all eukaryotic genomes. Often considered purely genomic parasites, transposons can also benefit their hosts, playing roles in gene regulation and in genome organization and evolution. Peaceful coexistence with mobile elements depends upon adaptive control mechanisms, since unchecked transposon activity can impact long-term fitness and acutely reduce the fertility of progeny. Here, we review the conserved roles played by small RNAs in the adaptation of eukaryotes to coexist with their genomic colonists. An understanding of transposon-defense pathways has uncovered recurring themes in the mechanisms by which genomes distinguish "self" from "non-self" and selectively silence the latter.},

The different RNA species that are produced in the nucleus are exported through the nuclear pore complexes via mobile export receptors. Small RNAs (such as tRNAs and microRNAs) follow relatively simple export routes by binding directly to export receptors. Large RNAs (such as ribosomal RNAs and mRNAs) assemble into complicated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles and recruit their exporters via class-specific adaptor proteins. Export of mRNAs is unique as it is extensively coupled to transcription (in yeast) and splicing (in metazoa). Understanding the mechanisms that connect RNP formation with export is a major challenge in the field.},

Arginine methylation of Ad (adenovirus) E1B 55-kDa-associated protein E1B-AP5 was recently described by us [Kzhyshkowska, Schutt, Liss, Kremmer, Stauber, Wolf and Dobner (2001) Biochem. J. 358, 305-314]. In this first example of protein arginine methylation analysis in Ad-infected cells, we investigated methylation of the E1B-AP5 and the viral L4-100 kDa protein. We demonstrate that E1B-AP5 methylation is enhanced during the course of infection in a cell-type-specific manner. We also show that L4-100 kDa is efficiently methylated in Ad-infected cells. L4-100 kDa formed complex with methyltransferase in vivo during productive infection, and can be methylated by HRMT1L2 (human protein arginine methyltransferase 1) in vitro. Comparative analysis of E1B-AP5 and L4-100 kDa protein methylation in Ad-infected HeLa, MCF-7 and H1299 cells revealed that the profile of protein arginine methylation correlates with the efficiency of Ad proteins production. Our results suggest that protein arginine methylation is an important host-cell function required for efficient Ad replication.},

abstract = {The human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kDa protein modulates several cellular processes, including activation of the tumor suppressor p53. Binding of the E1B protein to the activation domain of p53 inhibits p53-dependent transcription. This activity has been correlated with the transforming activity of the E1B protein, but its contribution to viral replication is not well understood. To address this issue, we used microarray hybridization methods to examine cellular gene expression in normal human fibroblasts (HFFs) infected by Ad5, the E1B 55-kDa-protein-null mutant Hr6, or a mutant carrying substitutions that impair repression of p53-dependent transcription. Comparison of the changes in cellular gene expression observed in these and our previous experiments (D. L. Miller et al., Genome Biol. 8:R58, 2007) by significance analysis of microarrays indicated excellent reproducibility. Furthermore, we again observed that Ad5 infection led to efficient reversal of the p53-dependent transcriptional program. As this same response was also induced in cells infected by the two mutants, we conclude that the E1B 55-kDa protein is not necessary to block activation of p53 in Ad5-infected cells. However, groups of cellular genes that were altered in expression specifically in the absence of the E1B protein were identified by consensus k-means clustering of the hybridization data. Statistical analysis of the enrichment of genes associated with specific functions in these clusters established that the E1B 55-kDa protein is necessary for repression of genes encoding proteins that mediate antiviral and immune defenses.},

Enzymatic modifications are widely believed to affect and regulate p53 activity. We describe here a level of post-translational control that has an important functional consequence on the p53 response. We show that the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 5, as a co-factor in a DNA damage responsive co-activator complex that interacts with p53, is responsible for methylating p53. Arginine methylation is regulated during the p53 response and affects the target gene specificity of p53. Furthermore, PRMT5 depletion triggers p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus, methylation on arginine residues is an underlying mechanism of control during the p53 response.},

abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from somatic cells by the introduction of Oct3/4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, in mouse and in human. The efficiency of this process, however, is low. Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency. A p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently shown to promote human iPS cell generation, but the specificity and mechanisms remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10\% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes that are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of these genes demonstrate that the p53-p21 pathway serves as a barrier not only in tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell generation.},

The sex of this plant is determined by heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes. It was revealed that SlSUP is a single-copy autosomal gene expressed exclusively in female flowers. Introduction of a genomic copy of SlSUP into the Arabidopsis thaliana sup (sup-2) mutant complemented the excess-stamen and infertile phenotypes of sup-2, and the overexpression of SlSUP in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in reduced stamen numbers as well as the suppression of petal elongation. During the development of the female flower in S. latifolia, the expression of SlSUP is first detectable in whorls 2 and 3 when the normal expression pattern of the B-class flowering genes was already established and persisted in the stamen primordia until the ovule had matured completely. In addition, significant expression of SlSUP was detected in the ovules, suggestive of the involvement of this gene in ovule development. Furthermore, it was revealed that the de-suppression of stamen development by infection of the S. latifolia female flower with Microbotryum violaceum was accompanied by a significant reduction in SlSUP transcript levels in the induced organs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SlSUP is a female flower-specific gene and suggest that SlSUP has a positive role in the female flower developmental pathways of S. latifolia.},

abstract = {Adenoviruses use virus-associated RNA I (VAI RNA) to counteract the cellular antiviral response mediated by the interferon-induced, double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase PKR. VAI RNA is a highly structured small RNA which consists of two long duplex regions connected at the center by a complex, short stem-loop. This short stem-loop and the adjacent base-paired regions, referred to as the central domain, bind to PKR and inactivate it. Currently it is not known whether binding of VAI RNA to PKR is dependent solely on the secondary (and tertiary) structure of the central domain or whether nucleotide sequences in the central domain are also critical for this interaction. To address this question, 54 VAI mutants with single-base substitution mutations in the central domain of the RNA were constructed, and their capacities to inhibit the autophosphoryation of PKR in vitro were determined. It was found that although about half of the mutants inhibited PKR activity as efficiently as the wild type, a significant number of mutants lost the inhibitory activity substantially, without a perceptible change in their secondary structures. These results indicate that, in addition to secondary structure, at least some nucleotides in the central domain may be critical for the efficient function of VAI RNA.},

However, the contribution(s) of these functions of the E1B protein to viral reproduction remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we examined properties of p53 in normal human cells infected by E1B mutant viruses that display defective entry into the late phase or viral late mRNA export. The steady-state concentrations of p53 were significantly higher in cells infected by the E1B 55 kDa null mutant Hr6 or three mutants carrying small insertions in the E1B 55 kDa protein coding sequence than in Ad5-infected cells. Nevertheless, none of the mutants induced apoptosis in infected cells. Rather, the localization of p53 to E1B containing nuclear sites observed during infection by Ad5 was prevented by mutations that impair interaction of the E1B protein with p53 and/or with the E4 Orf6 protein. These results indicate that the E1B protein fulfills an early function that correlates efficient entry into the late phase with the localization of E1B and p53 in the nucleus of Ad5-infected normal human cells.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms utilized by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to enter latency are poorly understood. Following the infection of Jurkat T cells with lentiviral vectors that express Tat in cis, gene expression is progressively silenced. Silencing is greatly enhanced when the lentiviral vectors carry an attenuated Tat gene with the H13L mutation. Individual clones of lentivirus-infected cells showed a wide range of shutdown rates, with the majority showing a 50\% silencing frequency between 30 to 80 days. The silenced clones characteristically contained a small fraction (0 to 15\%) of activated cells that continued to express d2EGFP. When d2EGFP(+) and d2EGFP(-) cell populations were isolated from the shutdown clones, they quickly reverted to the original distribution of inactive and active cells, suggesting that the d2EGFP(+) cells arise from stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. The detailed analysis of transcription initiation and elongation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirms that Tat levels are restricted in the latently infected cells but gradually rise during proviral reactivation. ChIP assays using clones of latently infected cells demonstrate that the latent proviruses carry high levels of deacetylated histones and trimethylated histones. In contrast, the cellular genes IkappaB alpha and GAPDH had high levels of acetylated histones and no trimethylated histones. The levels of trimethylated histone H3 and HP1-alpha associated with HIV proviruses fell rapidly after tumor necrosis factor alpha activation. The progressive shutdown of HIV transcription following infection suggests that epigenetic mechanisms targeting chromatin structures selectively restrict HIV transcription initiation. This decreases Tat production below the levels that are required to sustain HIV gene expression.},

abstract = {The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) early region 1B 55-kDa (E1B-55K) protein is a multifunctional regulator of cell-cycle-independent virus replication that participates in many processes required for maximal virus production. As part of a study of E1B-55K function, we generated the Ad5 mutant H5pm4133, carrying stop codons after the second and seventh codons of the E1B reading frame, thereby eliminating synthesis of the full-length 55K product and its smaller derivatives. Unexpectedly, phenotypic studies revealed that H5pm4133 fully exhibits the characteristics of wild-type (wt) Ad5 in all assays tested. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that H5pm4133 and wt Ad5 produce very low levels of two distinct polypeptides in the 48- to 49-kDa range, which lack the amino-terminal region but contain segments from the central and carboxy-terminal part of the 55K protein. Genetic and biochemical studies with different Ad5 mutants show that at least one of these isoforms consists of two closely migrating polypeptides of 433 amino acid residues (433R) and 422R, which are produced by translation initiation at two downstream AUG codons of the 55K reading frame. Significantly, a virus mutant producing low levels of the 433R isoform alone replicated to levels comparable to those of wt Ad5, demonstrating that this polypeptide provides essentially all functions of E1B-55K required to promote maximal virus growth in human tumor cells. Altogether, these results extend previous findings that the wt Ad5 E1B region encodes a series of smaller isoforms of E1B-55K and demonstrate that very low levels of at least one of these novel proteins (E1B-433R) are sufficient for a productive infection.},

abstract = {The E1B 55-kDa and E4 34-kDa oncoproteins of adenovirus type 5 (abbreviated here as E1B-55kD and E4-34kD) promote the export of viral mRNA and inhibit the export of most cellular mRNA species. We show that the intracellular complex containing E1B-55kD and E4-34kD continuously shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and may thus serve as a nucleocytoplasmic transporter for viral mRNA. We present evidence that within this complex, it is the E4-34kD protein that directs both nuclear import and nuclear export. E4-34kD contains a functional nuclear export signal similar to corresponding sequences found in the retroviral proteins rev and rex. This sequence element is required for nuclear export of the complex, and it can function autonomously when fused to a carrier protein and microinjected in HeLa cell nuclei. When E4-34kD is expressed alone, a portion of the protein that contains a predicted arginine-rich amphipathic alpha-helical structure mediates nuclear retention of the protein. This retention, however, can be abolished by the association with E1B-55kD or by a specific point mutation within the arginine-rich motif. The export of E4-34kD can be blocked by an HTLV-rex derived competitive inhibitor and overexpressed E4-34kD inhibits rev-mediated transport, suggesting that the export pathways accessed by the adenoviral and retroviral proteins share components. The interplay between two polypeptides as well as the involvement of a dominant nuclear retention domain are novel features that might contribute to the efficiency and regulation of the adenovirus export system.},

The major focus is on CBs in mammalian cells but we provide an overview of homologous CB structures in other organisms. We discuss the protein and RNA components of CBs, including factors recently found to associate in a cell cycle-dependent fashion or under specific metabolic or stress conditions. We also consider the dynamic properties of both CBs and their molecular components, based largely on recent data obtained thanks to the advent of improved in vivo detection and imaging methods. We discuss how these data contribute to an understanding of CB functions and highlight major questions that remain to be answered. Finally, we consider the interesting links that have emerged between CBs and alterations in nuclear structure apparent in a range of human pathologies, including cancer and inherited neurodegenerative diseases. We speculate on the relationship between CB function and molecular disease.},

abstract = {The ability of adenovirus to induce cell transformation depends on the E1A and E1B-55K oncoproteins. While E1A functionally inactivates the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, E1B-55K primarily interferes with the function of p53. In adenovirus transformed cells E1B-55K can directly affect p53-dependent transactivation. In virus-infected cells E1B-55K additionally cooperates with the viral E4orf6 protein to induce ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Here we unravel a novel activity of E1B-55K by demonstrating that it drastically stimulates the post-translational modification of p53 by the ubiquitin-like SUMO modifier. Consistent with this finding the extent of p53 SUMOylation is highly elevated in adenovirus transformed cell lines. E1B-55K-mediated SUMOylation depends on the direct interaction of E1B-55K with p53 and additionally requires SUMO modification of E1B-55K. These data suggest that E1B-55K exploits both ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like systems to target host cell proteins and thus shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of E1B- 55K function. Moreover, the data expand the emerging concept of dual-specificity factors that act in both the SUMO and ubiquitin pathway and identify E1B-55K as the first viral protein that shares this dual activity.},

abstract = {Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is essential for cells to survive many environmental stresses. Thus, it may be necessary to buffer ubiquitin and proteasome pools against fluctuation. Proteasome levels are tightly regulated, and proteasome deficiency stimulates a stress response. Here we report a novel pathway of cellular response to ubiquitin depletion. Unlike proteasome stress, ubiquitin stress does not upregulate proteasome abundance. Instead, ubiquitin stress alters proteasome composition. The proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6, which spares ubiquitin from proteasomal degradation, is induced by ubiquitin deficiency. This enhances loading of proteasomes with Ubp6, thereby altering proteasome function. A catalytically inactive mutant of Ubp6 fails to recycle ubiquitin and also inhibits proteasome function directly, thus inducing both ubiquitin stress and proteasome stress. These results show that homeostatic control of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can be achieved through signal-dependent, subunit-specific regulation of the proteasome, and indicate a dual role of Ubp6 in regulating ubiquitin levels and proteasome function.},

abstract = {SUMO-1 is a small ubiquitin-related modifier protein that is covalently linked to many cellular and viral protein targets. Modification by SUMO-1 is proposed to play a role in protein targeting and/or stability. We show here that adenovirus type 5 early region 1B 55-kDa (E1B-55kDa) oncoprotein can be covalently modified by SUMO-1 in vivo through a major attachment site comprising a single lysine residue at amino acid position 104. The sequence surrounding this lysine matches the proposed PsiKxE consensus motif required for SUMO-1 conjugation. A single mutation (K104R) that abolishes SUMOylation of E1B-55kDa dramatically reduces the ability of the adenovirus type 5 protein to transform primary baby rat kidney cells in cooperation with E1A and to inhibit p53-mediated transactivation. Overexpression of SUMO-1 in adenovirus type 5 E1A/E1B-55kDa-transformed baby rat kidney cells causes the relocalization of E1B-55kDa from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it accumulates with SUMO-1 in dot- or track-like structures. Significantly, when SUMO-1 is ectopically expressed in transformed rat cells no effect on the cytoplasmic localization of the E1B-K104R mutant protein is observed. Our results demonstrate that SUMO-1 modification is required for transformation by adenovirus type 5 E1B-55kDa and provide further evidence for the idea that this posttranslational modification plays a role in protein targeting to specific subcellular sites.},

Cells derived from patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder undergo radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS), failing to suppress DNA replication in response to ionizing radiation (IR). How MRN affects DNA replication to control the S-phase checkpoint, however, remains unclear. We demonstrate that MRN directly interacts with replication protein A (RPA) in unperturbed cells and that the interaction is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. We also show that this interaction is needed for MRN to correctly localize to replication centers. Abolishing the interaction of Mre11 with RPA leads to pronounced RDS without affecting phosphorylation of Nbs1 or SMC1 following IR. Moreover, MRN is recruited to sites at or adjacent to replication origins by RPA and acts there to inhibit new origin firing upon IR. These studies suggest a direct role of MRN at origin-proximal sites to control DNA replication initiation in response to DNA damage, thereby providing an important mechanism underlying the intra-S-phase checkpoint in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {The POU transcription factor Oct-4 is a master regulator affecting the fate of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. However, the precise mechanisms by which the activation and expression of Oct-4 are regulated still remain to be elucidated. We describe here a novel murine ubiquitin ligase, Wwp2, that specifically interacts with Oct-4 and promotes its ubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, the expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of Wwp2 abolishes Oct-4 ubiquitination. Moreover, Wwp2 promotes Oct-4 degradation in the presence of overexpressed ubiquitin. The degradation is blocked by treatment with proteasome inhibitor. Fusion of a single ubiquitin to Oct-4 inactivates its transcriptional activity in a heterologous Oct-4-driven reporter system. Furthermore, overexpression of Wwp2 in embryonic stem cells significantly reduces the Oct-4-transcriptional activities. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that Oct-4 can be post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and that this modification dramatically suppresses its transcriptional activity. These results reveal that the functional status of Oct-4, in addition to its expression level, dictates its transcriptional activity, and the results open up a new avenue to understand how Oct-4 defines the fate of embryonic stem cells.},

The sex chromosomes in hepatics, mosses, and gymnosperms are morphologically heteromorphic. In angiosperms, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are found in at least 19 species from 4 families, while homomorphic sex chromosomes occur in 20 species from 13 families. The prevalence of the XY system found in 44 out of 48 species may reflect the predominance of the evolutionary pathway from gynodioecy towards dioecy. All dioecious species have the potential to evolve sex chromosomes, and reversions back from dioecy to various forms of monoecy, gynodioecy, or androdioecy have also occurred. Such reversals may occur especially during the early stages of sex chromosome evolution before the lethality of the YY (or WW) genotype is established.},

abstract = {The adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein binds to cellular tumor suppressor p53 and inactivates its transcriptional transactivation function. p53 transactivation activity is dependent upon its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences near the promoters of its target genes. It was shown recently that p53 is acetylated by transcriptional coactivators p300, CREB bidning protein (CBP), and PCAF and that acetylation of p53 by these proteins enhances p53 sequence-specific DNA binding. Here we show that the E1B 55-kDa protein specifically inhibits p53 acetylation by PCAF in vivo and in vitro, while acetylation of histones and PCAF autoacetylation is not affected. Furthermore, the DNA-binding activity of p53 is diminished in cells expressing the E1B 55-kDa protein. PCAF binds to the E1B 55-kDa protein and to a region near the C terminus of p53 encompassing Lys-320, the specific PCAF acetylation site. We further show that the E1B 55-kDa protein interferes with the physical interaction between PCAF and p53, suggesting that the E1B 55-kDa protein inhibits PCAF acetylase function on p53 by preventing enzyme-substrate interaction. These results underscore the importance of p53 acetylation for its function and suggest that inhibition of p53 acetylation by viral oncoproteins prevent its activation, thereby contributing to viral transformation.},

In general, RNA is degraded at the end of its useful life, which is long for a ribosomal RNA but very short for excised introns or spacer fragments, and is closely regulated for most mRNA species. RNA molecules with defects in processing, folding, or assembly with proteins are identified and rapidly degraded by the surveillance machinery. Because RNA degradation is ubiquitous in all cells, it is clear that it must be carefully controlled to accurately recognize target RNAs.

abstract = {Given the growing number of tumor types recognizably associated with EBV infection, it is critically important that therapeutic strategies are developed to treat such tumors. Replication-selective oncolytic adenoviruses represent a promising new platform for anticancer therapy. Virus-associated I (VAI) RNAs of adenoviruses are required for efficient translation of viral mRNAs. When the VAI gene is deleted, adenovirus replication is impeded in most cells (including HEK 293 cells). EBV-encoded small RNA1 is uniformly expressed in most EBV-associated human tumors and can functionally substitute for the VAI RNAs of adenovirus. It enables replication to proceed through complementation of VAI-deletion mutants. We hypothesized that VAI-deleted adenovirus would selectively replicate in EBV-positive tumor cells due to the presence of EBV-encoded small RNA1 with no (or poor) replication in normal or EBV-negative tumor cells. In this report, we show that high levels of replication occurred in the VAI-deleted mutant in the EBV-positive tumor cells compared with low (or negligible) levels in EBV-negative and normal human primary cells. Correspondingly, high toxicity levels were observed in EBV-positive tumor cells but not in EBV-negative tumor or normal human primary cells. In vivo, VAI-deleted adenovirus showed superior antitumoral efficacy to wild-type adenovirus in EBV-positive tumor xenografts, with lower hepatotoxicity than wild-type adenovirus. Our data suggest that VAI-deleted adenovirus is a promising replication-selective oncolytic virus with targeting specificity for EBV-associated tumors.},

abstract = {The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) late region 4 (L4) 100-kDa nonstructural protein (L4-100K) mediates inhibition of cellular protein synthesis and selective translation of tripartite leader (TL)-containing viral late mRNAs via ribosome shunting. In addition, L4-100K has been implicated in the trimerization and nuclear localization of hexon protein. We previously proved that L4-100K is a substrate of the protein arginine methylation machinery, an emergent posttranslational modification system involved in a growing list of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, RNA processing, and DNA repair. As understood at present, L4-100K arginine methylation involves protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which asymmetrically dimethylates arginines embedded in arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) or glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domains. To identify the methylated arginine residues and assess the role of L4-100K arginine methylation, we generated amino acid substitution mutations in the RGG and GAR motifs to examine their effects in Ad-infected and plasmid-transfected cells. Arginine-to-glycine exchanges in the RGG boxes significantly diminished L4-100K methylation in the course of an infection and substantially reduced virus growth, demonstrating that L4-100K methylation in RGG motifs is an important host cell function required for efficient Ad replication. Our data further indicate that PRMT1-catalyzed arginine methylation in the RGG boxes regulates the binding of L4-100K to hexon and promotes the capsid assembly of the structural protein as well as modulating TL-mRNA interaction. Furthermore, substitutions in GAR, but not RGG, regions affected L4-100K nuclear import, implying that the nuclear localization signal of L4-100K is located within the GAR sequence.},

abstract = {We have investigated p53-E1b 58-kilodalton (kDa) protein complex formation during permissive and semipermissive infections with adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) dl309. While metabolic labeling studies easily detected p53-E1b 58-kDa protein complexes in transformed rat cells (XhoI-C), the same methods have not revealed complexes during infection of either human osteosarcoma cells (permissive) or normal rat kidney cells (semipermissive). Complexes were not detectable at any stage during the replicative cycle of Ad5 dl309 in osteosarcoma cells, and they could not be stabilized by using an in vivo cross-linking agent. In addition, using the E4-defective mutant Ad5 dl355, no complexes were observed either. Thus, the lack of p53-E1b 58-kDa protein complex formation during infection is not due to competition from the E4 34-kDa protein. In vitro association experiments showed that in vitro-translated mouse and human p53 could form complexes with E1b 58-kDa antigen expressed during infection. Thus, such E1b proteins are competent to form complexes. The converse experiment, in which in vitro-translated E1b 58-kDa protein was mixed with lysates of osteosarcoma cells, showed little or no p53-E1b 58-kDa protein association, even though the in vitro E1b 58-kDa protein could associate stably with p53 from cells containing endogenous p53-E1b 58-kDa protein complex. These data suggest that competence to form p53-E1b 58-kDa protein complexes resides in some property of p53.},

abstract = {The p53 tumor suppressor pathway is activated by defective ribosome synthesis. Ribosomal proteins are released from the nucleolus and block human double minute-2 (Hdm2) that targets p53 for degradation. However, it remained elusive how abrogation of individual rRNA processing pathways contributes to p53 stabilization. Here, we show that selective inhibition of 18 S rRNA processing provokes accumulation of p53 as efficiently as abrogated 28 S rRNA maturation. We describe hUTP18 as a novel mammalian rRNA processing factor that is specifically involved in 18 S rRNA production. hUTP18 was essential for the cleavage of the 5'-external transcribed spacer leader sequence from the primary polymerase I transcript, but was dispensable for rRNA transcription. Because maturation of the 28 S rRNA was unaffected in hUTP18-depleted cells, our results suggest that the integrity of both the 18 S and 28 S rRNA synthesis pathways can be monitored independently by the p53 pathway. Interestingly, accumulation of p53 after hUTP18 knock down required the ribosomal protein L11. Therefore, cells survey the maturation of the small and large ribosomal subunits by separate molecular routes, which may merge in an L11-dependent signaling pathway for p53 stabilization.},

abstract = {The adenovirus type 5 mutant dl1520 was engineered previously to be completely defective for E1B-55K functions. Recently, this mutant (also known as ONYX-015) has been suggested to replicate preferentially in p53(-) and some p53(+) tumor cell lines but to be attenuated in primary cultured cells (C. Heise, A. Sampson-Johannes, A. Williams, F. McCormick, D. D. F. Hoff, and D. H. Kirn, Nat. Med. 3:639-645, 1997). It has been suggested that dl1520 might be used as a "magic bullet" that could selectively lyse tumor cells without harm to normal tissues. However, we report here that dl1520 replication is independent of p53 genotype and occurs efficiently in some primary cultured human cells, indicating that the mutant virus does not possess a tumor selectivity. Although it was not the sole host range determinant, p53 function did reduce dl1520 replication when analyzed in a cell line expressing temperature-sensitive p53 (H1299-tsp53) (K. L. Fries, W. E. Miller, and N. Raab-Traub, J. Virol. 70:8653-8659, 1996). As found earlier for other E1B-55K mutants in HeLa cells (Y. Ho, R. Galos, and J. Williams, Virology 122:109-124, 1982), dl1520 replication was temperature dependent in H1299 cells. When p53 function was restored at low temperature in H1299-tsp53 cells, it imposed a modest defect in viral DNA replication and accumulation of late viral cytoplasmic mRNA. However, in both H1299 and H1299-tsp53 cells, the defect in late viral protein synthesis appeared to be much greater than could be accounted for by the modest defects in late viral mRNA levels. We therefore propose that in addition to countering p53 function and modulating viral and cellular mRNA nuclear transport, E1B-55K also stimulates late viral mRNA translation.},

abstract = {The regulation of transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a complex event of significant pathological relevance, which recapitulates general concepts of cellular transcription with some peculiarities. The viral promoter is embedded in a chromatin structure that exerts powerful repression on transcription; activation of gene expression relies on the combined activity of a series of cellular factors that respond to different external stimuli, and on the function of a single viral regulatory protein, the Tat transactivator. Transcriptional activation is consequent to both chromatin remodeling and to the recruitment of elongation-competent RNA polymerase II complexes onto the integrated promoter, two events that require the coordinate, but transient, assembly of different protein complexes. Application of optical imaging techniques now allows us to appreciate the spatial and temporal evolvement of these reactions in vivo. The picture that is emerging is not only descriptive, but also relevant to the understanding of the regulation of the process. In particular, it appears that the confinement of biomolecules within specific subcellular compartments represents a way to control and coordinate the assembly of functional complexes that regulate viral gene expression.},

abstract = {The E1B 55-kDa oncoprotein of adenovirus enables the virus to overcome restrictions imposed on viral replication by the cell cycle. Approximately 20\% of HeLa cells infected with an E1B 55-kDa mutant adenovirus produced virus when evaluated by electron microscopy or by assays for infectious centers. By contrast, all HeLa cells infected with a wild-type adenovirus produced virus. The yield of E1B mutant virus from randomly cycling HeLa cells correlated with the fraction of cells in S phase at the time of infection. In synchronously growing HeLa cells, approximately 75\% of the cells infected during S phase with the E1B mutant virus produced virus, whereas only 10\% of the cells infected during G1 produced virus. The yield of E1B mutant virus from HeLa cells infected during S phase was sevenfold greater than that of cells infected during G1 and threefold greater than that of cells infected during asynchronous growth. Cells infected during S phase with the E1B mutant virus exhibited severe cytopathic effects, whereas cells infected with the E1B mutant virus during G1 exhibited a mild cytopathic effect. Viral DNA synthesis appeared independent of the cell cycle because equivalent amounts of viral DNA were synthesized in cells infected with either wild-type or E1B mutant virus. The inability of the E1B mutant virus to replicate was not mediated by the status of p53. These results define a novel property of the large tumor antigen of adenovirus in relieving growth restrictions imposed on viral replication by the cell cycle.},

The stress-induced subnuclear compartmentalization of HSF1 into nuclear stress granules has been suggested to be an important control step in the regulation of stress response and cellular homeostasis in human cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the less-well characterized HSF2 interacts physically with HSF1 and is a novel stress-responsive component of the stress granules. Based on analysis of our deletion mutants, HSF2 influences to the localization of HSF1 in stress granules. Moreover, our results indicate that the stress granules are dynamic structures and suggest that they might be regulated in an Hsp70-dependent manner. The reversible localization of Hsp70 in the nucleoli strictly coincides with the presence of HSF1 in stress granules and is dramatically suppressed in thermotolerant cells. We propose that the regulated subcellular distribution of Hsp70 is an important regulatory mechanism of HSF1-mediated heat shock response.},

abstract = {The overexpression of defined transcription factors in somatic cells results in their reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The extremely low efficiency and slow kinetics of in vitro reprogramming suggest that further rare events are required to generate iPS cells. The nature and identity of these events, however, remain elusive. We noticed that the reprogramming potential of primary murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and the concomitant onset of senescence. Consistent with the notion that loss of replicative potential provides a barrier for reprogramming, here we show that cells with low endogenous p19(Arf) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a locus) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies with up to threefold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher efficiency than wild-type cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of Trp53 (also known as p53) in cellular subpopulations that normally fail to reprogram rescues their ability to produce iPS cells. Our results show that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in somatic cells and underscore the similarities between induced pluripotency and tumorigenesis.},

High-level expression of wild-type p53 can induce apoptosis in certain cell types, and this activity can be blocked by the adenovirus E1B 19-kDa oncoprotein or by the cellular Bcl-2 oncoprotein. Here we report that p53-mediated repression of promoters that lack a p53 binding site is abrogated by the E1B 19-kDa protein or Bcl-2 oncoprotein. In contrast, transcriptional activation by p53 still occurs in the presence of either protein. The fact that two oncoproteins capable of preventing p53-mediated apoptosis also block transcriptional repression by p53 raises the possibility that p53 might induce apoptosis, at least in part, by repressing transcription.},

abstract = {Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) open reading frame (ORF) 63 protein (ORF63p) is one of six VZV ORFs shown to be transcribed and translated in latently infected human dorsal root ganglia. ORF63p accumulates exclusively in the cytoplasm of latently infected sensory neurons, whereas it is both nuclear and cytoplasmic during lytic infection and following reactivation from latency. Here, we demonstrate that infection of primary guinea pig enteric neurons (EN) with an adenovirus expressing ORF63p results in the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of the protein reminiscent of its distribution during latent VZV infection in humans. We show that the addition of the simian virus 40 large-T-antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) results in the nuclear import of ORF63p in EN and that the ORF63p endogenous NLSs are functional in EN when fused to a heterologous protein. These data suggest that the cytoplasmic localization of ORF63p in EN results from the masking of the NLSs, thus blocking nuclear import. However, the coexpression of ORF61p, a strictly lytic VZV protein, and ORF63p in EN results in the nuclear import of ORF63p in a proteasome-dependent manner, and both ORF63p NLSs are required for this event. We propose that the cytoplasmic localization of ORF63p in neurons results from NLS masking and that the expression of ORF61p removes this block, allowing nuclear import to proceed.},

abstract = {One important function of the human adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein is induction of selective nuclear export of viral late mRNAs. This protein interacts with the viral E4 Orf6 and four cellular proteins to form an infected-cell-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. The assembly of this enzyme is required for efficient viral late mRNA export, but neither the relevant substrates nor the cellular pathway that exports viral late mRNAs has been identified. We therefore examined the effects on viral late gene expression of inhibition of the synthesis or activity of the mRNA export receptor Nxf1, which was observed to colocalize with the E1B 55-kDa protein in infected cells. When production of Nxf1 was impaired by using RNA interference, the efficiency of viral late mRNA export was reduced to a corresponding degree. Furthermore, synthesis of a dominant-negative derivative of Nxf1 during the late phase of infection interfered with production of a late structural protein. These observations indicate that the Nxf1 pathway is responsible for export of viral late mRNAs. As the infected-cell-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase targets its known substrates for proteasomal degradation, we compared the concentrations of several components of this pathway (Nxf1, Thox1, and Thoc4) in infected cells that did or did not contain this enzyme. Although the concentration of a well-established substrate, Mre11, decreased significantly in cells infected by adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), but not in those infected by the E1B 55-kDa protein-null mutant Hr6, no E1B 55-kDa protein-dependent degradation of the Nxf1 pathway proteins was observed.},

abstract = {Adenovirus infection activates cellular DNA damage response and repair pathways. Viral proteins that are synthesized before viral DNA replication prevent recognition of viral genomes as a substrate for DNA repair by targeting members of the sensor complex composed of Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 for degradation and relocalization, as well as targeting the effector protein DNA ligase IV. Despite inactivation of these cellular sensor and effector proteins, infection results in high levels of histone 2AX phosphorylation, or gammaH2AX. Although phosphorylated H2AX is a characteristic marker of double-stranded DNA breaks, this modification was widely distributed throughout the nucleus of infected cells and was coincident with the bulk of cellular DNA. H2AX phosphorylation occurred after the onset of viral DNA replication and after the degradation of Mre11. Experiments with inhibitors of the serine-threonine kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), AT- and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK), the kinases responsible for H2AX phosphorylation, indicate that H2AX may be phosphorylated by ATR during a wild-type adenovirus infection, with some contribution from ATM and DNA-PK. Viral DNA replication appears to be the stimulus for this phosphorylation event, since infection with a nonreplicating virus did not elicit phosphorylation of H2AX. Infected cells also responded to high levels of input viral DNA by localized phosphorylation of H2AX. These results are consistent with a model in which adenovirus-infected cells sense and respond to both incoming viral DNA and viral DNA replication.},

Here we show that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) can direct translation without eIF2 and its GTPase-activating protein eIF5. In addition to the general eIF2- and eIF5-dependent pathway of 80S complex assembly, the HCV IRES makes use of a bacterial-like pathway requiring as initiation factors only eIF5B (an analog of bacterial IF2) and eIF3. The switch from the conventional eukaryotic mode of translation initiation to the eIF2-independent mechanism occurs when eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation under stress conditions.},

abstract = {Adenovirus infection results in the suppression of cellular protein synthesis, but the mechanism has not been established. In this report we demonstrate that the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis by adenovirus is prevented in cells by treatment with the drug 2-aminopurine. Treatment with 2-aminopurine is shown to prevent suppression of cellular translation without disrupting the normal viral block in the transport of cellular mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We show that viral suppression of cellular protein synthesis occurs concomitant with activation of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor (DAI), a protein kinase, and phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha), but that prevention of host cell shut-off by 2-aminopurine occurs without a decrease in kinase activity or a dephosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. Results are presented that indicate that activation of DAI kinase and phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha may be required but are not sufficient to achieve inhibition of cellular protein synthesis during adenovirus infection. We suggest that other events, in particular the modification of additional initiation factors, are likely involved in viral inhibition of cellular translation.},

abstract = {Human Alu and adenovirus VA1 RNAs each stimulate the translational expression of reporter genes in co-transient transfection assays without affecting either the rate of global protein synthesis or the abundance of the reporter mRNA. This selective, post-transcriptional stimulation of expression, which is observed in human and mouse cell lines and for three reporters, acts through a PKR- independent mechanism. The activity of Alu and VA1 RNAs in this assay is transient, causing a reduction in the lag time for the translational expression of the newly synthesized reporter mRNAs. The reduction in this lag time accounts for the relative selectivity of the effect upon the expression of the reporter and suggests novel roles for Alu and VA1 RNA in cell stress recovery and viral infection. Deletion analysis demonstrates that a specific region residing within the right monomer of the dimeric Alu consensus sequence is necessary for activity. Highly abundant left Alu monomer transcripts are inactive but the right Alu monomer is fully active, although its transcripts are scarce. Mouse B1 and B2 SINE RNAs stimulate reporter gene expression in mouse cells, suggesting that this activity is a general property of eucaryotic SINEs.},

abstract = {The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) late region 4 (L4) 100-kDa nonstructural protein (L4-100K) mediates inhibition of cellular protein synthesis and selective translation of tripartite leader (TL)-containing viral late mRNAs via ribosome shunting. In addition, L4-100K has been implicated in the trimerization and nuclear localization of hexon protein. We previously proved that L4-100K is a substrate of the protein arginine methylation machinery, an emergent posttranslational modification system involved in a growing list of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, RNA processing, and DNA repair. As understood at present, L4-100K arginine methylation involves protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which asymmetrically dimethylates arginines embedded in arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) or glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domains. To identify the methylated arginine residues and assess the role of L4-100K arginine methylation, we generated amino acid substitution mutations in the RGG and GAR motifs to examine their effects in Ad-infected and plasmid-transfected cells. Arginine-to-glycine exchanges in the RGG boxes significantly diminished L4-100K methylation in the course of an infection and substantially reduced virus growth, demonstrating that L4-100K methylation in RGG motifs is an important host cell function required for efficient Ad replication. Our data further indicate that PRMT1-catalyzed arginine methylation in the RGG boxes regulates the binding of L4-100K to hexon and promotes the capsid assembly of the structural protein as well as modulating TL-mRNA interaction. Furthermore, substitutions in GAR, but not RGG, regions affected L4-100K nuclear import, implying that the nuclear localization signal of L4-100K is located within the GAR sequence.},

An analysis of hub proteins identified intermodular hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners in a tissue-restricted manner and intramodular hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners in all or most tissues. Substantial differences in biochemical structure were observed between the two types of hubs. Signaling domains were found more often in intermodular hub proteins, which were also more frequently associated with oncogenesis. Analysis of two breast cancer patient cohorts revealed that altered modularity of the human interactome may be useful as an indicator of breast cancer prognosis.},

Microarray analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions demonstrated that efficient export of the majority of viral transcripts requires that ICP27 be able to bind RNA and to interact with TAP/NXF1.

In addition, E1B-55kDa provides functions required for complete oncogenic transformation of rodent cells in cooperation with the E1A proteins. Using the far-Western technique, we have isolated human genes encoding E1B-55kDa-associated proteins (E1B-APs). The E1B-AP5 gene encodes a novel nuclear RNA-binding protein of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family that is highly related to hnRNP-U/SAF-A. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that two distinct segments in the 55-kDa polypeptide which partly overlap regions responsible for p53 binding are required for complex formation with E1B-AP5 in Ad-infected cells and that this protein interaction is modulated by the adenovirus E4orf6 protein. Expression of E1B-AP5 efficiently interferes with Ad5 E1A/E1B-mediated transformation of primary rat cells. Furthermore, stable expression of E1B-AP5 in Ad-infected cells overcomes the E1B-dependent inhibition of cytoplasmic host mRNA accumulation. These data suggest that E1B-AP5 might play a role in RNA transport and that this function is modulated by E1B-55kDa in Ad-infected cells.},

Two widespread eukaryotic phosphoinositide-based signal transduction mechanisms, phosphoinositidase C-catalysed phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) hydrolysis and 3-OH kinase-catalysed PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphorylation, make the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns3P have been implicated in exocytosis and membrane trafficking. We now show that when the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe are hyperosmotically stressed, they rapidly synthesize phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) by a process that involves activation of a PtdIns3P 5-OH kinase. This PtdIns(3,5)P2 accumulation only occurs in yeasts that have an active vps34-encoded PtdIns 3-OH kinase, showing that this latter kinase makes the PtdIns3P needed for PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis and indicating that PtdIns(3,5)P2 may have a role in sorting vesicular proteins. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is also present in mammalian and plant cells: in monkey Cos-7 cells, its labelling is inversely related to the external osmotic pressure. The stimulation of a PtdIns3P 5-OH kinase-catalysed synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2, a molecule that might be a new type of phosphoinositide 'second messenger, thus appears to be central to a widespread and previously uncharacterized regulatory pathway.},

From this study we discovered that 18 residues within the four histones are essential for viability on complete growth media. We also identified several cis-regulatory residues on the histone H3 N-terminal tail, including histone H3 lysine 14 (H3K14), which are required for normal levels of H3K4 trimethylation. Several previously uncharacterized trans-regulatory residues on histones H2A and H2B form a patch on nucleosomes and are required for methylation mediated by COMPASS.

Publications are the main way scientists publicize their work, and ultimately, it is by their papers that they will be judged. So what makes a good paper? The most fundamental ingredient is excellent research. Work with the best scientists you can, in the best lab you can find. You will absorb the most about doing excellent science if you are surrounded by it during your training. Then make sure that the questions you investigate are important and of interest to others in the field. As an editor at Science, I see that the most successful papers are those that present innovative re- search. But the best papers also present their story in a clear and logical way. The thinking behind the paper is clear, so the writing is clear. Writing research papers with all these qualities can require a bit of strategic thinking, practice, and know-how.},

We review 52 articles in organization studies and develop a typology of how researchers construct their research questions from existing literature. The most common way across paradigmatic camps is to spot various gaps' in the literature and, based on that, to formulate specific research questions. The dominance of gap-spotting is surprising, given it is increasingly recognized that theory is made interesting and influential when it challenges assumptions that underlie existing literature. The article discusses why assumption-challenging approaches are rare, and it identifies a range of social norms that favour gap-spotting. Finally, the article proposes some ways of constructing research questions that move beyond gap-spotting, and discusses how these ways are likely to promote more interesting and significant theories.},

Along with highlighting the reasons faculty should consider publishing with undergraduates, we identify the particular challenges that accompany this suggestion and discuss strategies for overcoming them. Our resource includes two decision trees for helping faculty determine whether publishing with undergraduates represents a reasonable and attainable goal and whether an undergraduate has earned authorship. Based on our experience at primarily undergraduate institutions, we provide a list of strategies that may facilitate writing with undergraduates and lead to certain milestones in the careers of both students and faculty.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {The role of organic and minerogenic acidity in controlling pH levels in Finnish rivers was studied by measuring total organic carbon (TOC) and non-marine sulphate (*SO(4)) concentrations in river water of the main river basins and their sub-basins. The basins are located along a latitudinal gradient (60 degrees N to 69 degrees N) and cover 297,322 km(2), 88\% of the total area of Finland. The basins are predominately covered by coniferous forests and peatlands, and are located in areas with low sulphate deposition (80-430 mg S m(-2) a(-1)). The proportion of the basin covered by forests on mineral soils ranges from 29 to 64\% and the proportion of peatlands from 3 to 60\%. The percentage of peatland is highest in northern Finland (28-60\%), whereas the proportion of forests on mineral soils increases towards the south. The majority of the agricultural land is located in southern and western Finland. *SO(4) concentrations were positively correlated with the proportion of agricultural land in the basin. Moreover, the percentage of peatlands had a positive correlation with the concentrations of TOC and organic anion. High peatland proportion and high TOC and organic anion concentrations decreased pH values in the river water, whereas no correlation between *SO(4) concentrations and pH was observed. The average organic anion concentration exceeded the average *SO(4) concentration in river water in 17 basins out of the 86 studied basins. The organic anion-dominated areas were situated in northern basins, reflecting the high extent of peatlands in these areas. *SO(4) dominated in southern Finland and in western coastal areas, where the extent of agricultural land, acid sulphate soils and the deposition of sulphate is highest.},

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the state of the riverine organic carbon in the Luodingjiang River under human impacts, such as reforestation, construction of reservoirs and in-stream damming. Seasonal and spatial characteristics of total suspended sediment (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), as well as C/N ratios and the stable carbon isotopic signatures of POC (delta(13)C(POC)) were examined based on a one-year study (2005) in the basin-wide scale. More frequent sampling was conducted in the outlet of the river basin at Guanliang hydrological station. DOC and POC concentrations showed flush effects with increasing water discharge and sediment load in the basin-wide scale. Atomic C/N ratio of POC had a positive relationship with TSS in the outlet of the basin, indicating the reduced aquatic sources and enhanced terrestrial sources during the high flood season. However, the similar relationship was not observed in the basin-wide scale mainly due to the spatial distributions of soil organic carbon and TSS. delta(13)C(POC) showed obvious seasonal variations with enriched values in the period with high TSS concentration, reflecting the increased contribution from C(4) plants with enhanced soil erosion. The specific flux of the total organic carbon (2.30 t km(-)(2) year(-1)) was smaller than the global average level. The ratio of DOC to POC was 1.17, which is higher than most rivers under Asian monsoon climate regime. The organic carbon flux was estimated to decline with decreasing sediment load as a result of reforestation, reservoir construction and in-stream damming, which demonstrates the impacts of human disturbances on the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {In order to understand the fate of pesticides in marine environments, concentrations of pesticides and different carbonaceous fractions were determined for surface sediments in the Danshui River and nearby coastal areas of Taiwan. The major compounds detected were tetrachlorobenzene, HCHs, chlordane, aldrin, DDDs, DDEs and DDTs. Total concentrations of pesticides in the sediments ranged from not detectable to 23 ng g(-1), with the maximum value detected near the discharge point of the marine outfall from the Pali sewage treatment plant. These results confirm that pesticides persist in estuarine and nearby coastal environments of the Danshui River well after their ban. Concentrations of total pesticides significantly correlate with concentrations of total organic carbon and black carbon in these sediments, suggesting that total organic carbon and black carbon regulate the distribution of trace organic pollutants in fluvial and coastal marine sediments.},

abstract = {The contribution of small watersheds to coastal pollution in Mediterranean areas is still poorly known, and presents great variations along an hydrological year. This work deals with the characterization and quantification of Al, Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, Si, NO(3)(-) and organic carbon transported from the continent to the sea by a small coastal river in the French Mediterranean area. Transported species were characterized both during rainy and dry periods. During non-rainy periods (base-flow), waters showed a low content of contaminants, whereas during heavy rain events, following dry periods, some metals and organic carbon reached concentrations that could affect biological populations. These contaminants were mainly found in the particulate fraction, originating from the runoff of surface waters, which represents the main process of pollution in urban areas.},

abstract = {Data are presented for particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) concentrations in the Humber Estuary and tidal River Ouse Estuary. The POC data were derived from approximately monthly surveys and are consistent with data reported for suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the non-tidal River Ouse (the freshwater river) and with SPM, or bed sediments, in estuarine ecosystems such as the Mississippi, Delaware, San Francisco Bay, Tolo Harbour, the Vellar Estuary and Cochin Backwater, as well as the Loire, Gironde, Ems and Tamar Estuaries. Relative to the dry weight of SPM, the Humber-averaged organic carbon and nitrogen percentages during the year February 1995-March 1996 were 2.6 +/- 0.6\% (mean and S.D.) and 0.21 +/- 0.04\%, respectively. The ratio of Humber-averaged POC to Humber-averaged PN was 13 +/- 3. Higher POC levels were observed near the Humber's mouth and in the adjacent coastal zone during 'bloom' conditions, and in the upper estuarine reaches during large, winter and springtime freshwater inflows. At these times of high runoff, the POC content of SPM increased progressively up-estuary from the coastal zone to the tidal River Ouse. When inflows became very low, during late spring to early autumn of 1995, both the freshwater-saltwater interface (FSI) and the strengthening turbidity maximum (TM) moved further up-estuary and the POC content of SPM in the upper reaches of the Ouse became lower compared with that immediately down-estuary. This led to a poorly defined POC maximum near the confluence of the Humber, Ouse and Trent, before POC eventually decreased again towards the coastal zone. The lower POC contents in the upper estuarine reaches of the tidal Ouse may have been partly due to POC respiration by heterotrophic bacteria attached to SPM within the TM, consistent with the severe oxygen depletion observed there during high turbidity, summertime spring tides.},

abstract = {Forty surface and twenty-two deeper sediment samples were collected from the Beijiang River and analyzed to acquire information about the levels, distribution, possible sources and influencing factors of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the Beijiang River. Our results showed that the most abundant BDE congeners in surface sediments were BDE47, 99 and 209, with a median value of 0.044, 0.03, and 5.22 ng g(-1), respectively. The levels of BDE209 in our samples were much higher relative to those of the other BDE congeners and made up more than 90\% of the PBDEs levels in almost all samples. Disregarding BDE209, of the remaining 9 BDE congeners the most abundant ones were BDE47 and 99, which contributed 35.7\% and 24.6\%, respectively, to the median of the 9 congeners. The contribution of the Beijiang River to the PBDE pollution burden of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) was small in comparison to that of the Dongjiang River and the Guangzhou section of the Zhujiang River. PBDEs in the Beijiang River mainly came from use of deca-BDE and penta-BDE with a minor contribution of octa-BDE. The poor correlation between PBDE and TOC may indicate that PBDEs concentrations in the sediments of the Beijiang River were controlled not only by TOC contents, but also by a combined effect of transport, mixing, depositional mechanisms associated with PBDEs, uncontaminated sediments, or fresh input of PBDEs.},

abstract = {A dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sampling study was carried out on the River Swale in Yorkshire as part of the NERC LOIS programme. Loads of DOC were calculated from the river and its tributaries. For the River Swale calculated loads varied between 1900 and 9000 kg/day and for the tributaries between 1 and 8500 kg/day. No relationship was found between the amount of organic carbon in the soil of the catchments and the DOC loads, perhaps because of the preceding dry summer. DOC loads were also estimated for sewage point sources and ranged between 7 and 287 kg/day. Some of the catchments draining to the River Swale respond with high DOC loads during high flow conditions, others do not. Some catchments are dominated by sewage point sources during low flows and diffuse sources during high flows. A mass balance for DOC on the River Swale was calculated, however, loads from inputs did not balance with outputs because of a lack of data and errors inherent in some of the approaches used. Despite this, results indicate in-stream losses of approximately 20\%. A highly detailed measurement study of a stretch of river is recommended to identify all the sources and sinks of DOC, the relative size of their contribution and how they respond in differing conditions.},

The data were obtained in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) using a non-ionic surfactant as sole carbon source and sludge previously acclimatised to a different surfactant. The model was successfully applied to successive SBR-cycles of sludge acclimatisation processes subjected to two ethoxylated surfactants. The model was validated using the corresponding total organic carbon data. The evolution of the model parameters along the acclimatisation process was examined. An acclimatisation model was developed using the evolution of two of these parameters (affinity constant and inhibition constant), supported by two independently calculated acclimatisation indicators. This acclimatisation model was then applied to determine an optimal surfactant concentration sequence to feed non-acclimatised sludge during a period of 41 days, in order to induce pre-acclimatisation to this surfactant before it replaces another one in the wastewater. The model was also useful in the economical assessment of this and alternative procedures to cope with frequent changes in activated sludge feed composition.},

Results from dynamic experiments conducted with the endocrine disrupting XOC bisphenol-A (BPA) in an activated sludge process with real wastewater were used to hypothesize an ASM-based process model including aerobic growth of a specific BPA-degrading microorganism and sorption of BPA to sludge. A parameter estimation method was developed, which simultaneously utilizes steady-state background concentrations and dynamic step response data, as well as conceptual simplifications of the plant configuration. Validation results show that biodegradation of BPA is sensitive to operational conditions before and during the experiment and that the proposed model structure is capable of capturing important characteristics of the observed BPA removal, thus increasing the potential for generalizing knowledge obtained from plant specific experiments.},

Based on chamber fluxes, the ecosystem had a gross primary production of 1490 g C m(-2) year(-1), 90\% of which was released as efflux back into the air via respiration of the entire ecosystem. This was comprised of about 48\% from soil surface CO(2) efflux, 31\% from leaf respiration and 21\% from stem and branch respiration. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE), estimated from the sum of daily component fluxes, was 146 g C m(-2) year(-1). Ecosystem respiration (ER), estimated from the sum of daily ecosystem respiration, was 1240 g C m(-2) year(-1). NEE was 9.8\% of actual gross primary production (GPP). The eddy covariance estimates of NEE, ER and GPP were 188, 1030 and 1220 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The eddy covariance estimation of NEE was higher than that of the chamber-based estimation by 22.5\%. On a daily basis, NEE of the scaled chamber measurements was in acceptable agreement with eddy covariance measurement data with R(2) values of 0.71. The discrepancy between the measurement of the two methods was greater in the non-growing season primarily due to the lack of spatial variability in the scaled chamber estimates and weak atmosphere turbulence by eddy covariance measurements. There are many uncertainties for determination of absolute values of ecosystem component flux. More detailed experiments and related theoretical studies are needed in the future.},
